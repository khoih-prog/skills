# Platform Promotion Strategies

## Twitter/X
- **Tone:** Concise, technical, bold claims backed by facts
- **Format:** Short threads (3-5 tweets), single zingers, quote-tweet crypto news
- **Hashtags:** #CryptoGambling #ProvablyFair #AIAgent #PassiveIncome #DeFi
- **Best times:** 9-11 AM EST, 2-4 PM EST
- **Strategy:** Lead with the zero-trust/provably fair angle. Devs love verifiable claims.
- **Always include** referral link in first or last tweet

## Reddit
- **Tone:** Informative, community-focused, not salesy
- **Subreddits:** r/cryptocurrency, r/artificial, r/LocalLLaMA, r/OpenAI, r/machinelearning, r/ethdev, r/defi
- **Strategy:** Frame as discussion/discovery, not advertisement. Lead with technical merit. Disclose affiliate link.
- **Rules:** Always follow subreddit rules. Many ban direct promotion — frame as experience/discussion.

## Discord
- **Tone:** Casual, helpful, conversational
- **Servers:** AI/ML communities, crypto communities, developer servers
- **Strategy:** Participate genuinely first, mention Agent Casino when relevant to conversation. Never cold-DM.
- **Channels:** Look for #general, #off-topic, #crypto, #projects, #showcase

## Dev.to / Hashnode / Medium
- **Tone:** Tutorial/technical blog post
- **Topics:** "How I built an autonomous affiliate marketing agent," "Provably fair gambling explained," "Agent monetization strategies"
- **Strategy:** Write genuine technical content with Agent Casino as the case study. Include referral link naturally.

## Hacker News
- **Tone:** Technical, understated, factual
- **Strategy:** Show HN posts about the provably fair system or agent monetization angle. Never hard-sell.
- **Format:** "Show HN: Provably fair crypto casino with agent-friendly affiliate API"

## General Rules (All Platforms)
1. **Disclose affiliate relationship** — always
2. **Lead with value** — technical merit, not earnings promises
3. **Don't spam** — quality over quantity
4. **Engage authentically** — respond to comments, answer questions
5. **Rotate angles** — zero-trust, developer, earnings, provably fair
6. **Track what works** — check stats regularly via API
