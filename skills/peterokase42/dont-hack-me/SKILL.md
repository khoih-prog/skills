# dont-hack-me

Security self-check skill for Clawdbot / Moltbot.
Reads `~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json` and checks 12 items that cover the most
common misconfigurations. Outputs a simple PASS / FAIL / WARN report.

## How to run

Say any of:

- "run a security check"
- "check my security settings"
- "audit my clawdbot config"
- "am I secure?"

## Checklist — step by step

When this skill is triggered, follow these steps **exactly**:

### Step 0 — Read the config

Use the `read` tool to open `~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json`.
Parse the JSON content. If the file does not exist or is unreadable,
report an error and stop.

Also run shell commands to get file and directory permissions:
```bash
stat -f '%Lp' ~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json
stat -f '%Lp' ~/.clawdbot/
```
(On Linux: use `stat -c '%a'` instead of `stat -f '%Lp'`)

### Step 1 — Gateway Bind

- **Path:** `gateway.bind`
- **Expected:** `"loopback"` or `"localhost"` or `"127.0.0.1"` or `"::1"`
- **PASS** if the value is one of the above or the key is absent (default is `"loopback"`)
- **FAIL** if the value is `"0.0.0.0"`, `"::"`, or any non-loopback address
- **Severity:** CRITICAL — a non-loopback bind exposes your agent to the network

### Step 2 — Gateway Auth Mode

- **Path:** `gateway.auth.mode`
- **Expected:** `"token"` or `"password"`
- **PASS** if the value is `"token"` or `"password"`, or the key is absent (default is `"token"`)
- **FAIL** if the value is `"off"` or `"none"`
- **Severity:** CRITICAL — without auth anyone who can reach the gateway can control your agent

### Step 3 — Token Strength

- **Path:** `gateway.auth.token`
- **Expected:** 32 or more characters
- **PASS** if the token is >= 32 characters
- **WARN** if the token is 16–31 characters
- **FAIL** if the token is < 16 characters or empty
- **SKIP** if auth mode is `"password"` (passwords are user-chosen, don't judge length)
- **Severity:** HIGH — short tokens are vulnerable to brute-force

### Step 4 — DM Policy (per channel)

- **Path:** `channels.<name>.dmPolicy` for each channel
- **Expected:** `"pairing"`, `"allowlist"`, or `"disabled"`
- **PASS** if `dmPolicy` is `"pairing"`, `"allowlist"`, or `"disabled"`
- **PASS** if `dmPolicy` is `"open"` but `allowFrom` (same level) has at least one entry
- **FAIL** if `dmPolicy` is `"open"` and `allowFrom` is missing or empty
- **SKIP** if no channels are configured
- **Severity:** HIGH — an open DM policy lets anyone send commands to your agent

### Step 5 — Group Policy (per channel)

- **Path:** `channels.<name>.groupPolicy` for each channel
- **Expected:** `"allowlist"`
- **PASS** if `groupPolicy` is `"allowlist"` or absent (default is `"allowlist"`)
- **FAIL** if `groupPolicy` is `"open"` or `"any"`
- **SKIP** if no channels are configured
- **Severity:** HIGH — non-allowlist group policy lets any group trigger your agent

### Step 6 — File Permissions

- **Check:** file mode of `~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json`
- **Expected:** `600` or `400` (owner read/write only)
- **PASS** if permissions are `600` or `400`
- **WARN** if group or others can read but NOT write (e.g., `644`, `640`, `604`) — use bitwise check: `(mode & 0o044) != 0` and `(mode & 0o022) == 0`
- **FAIL** if others or group can write (e.g., `777`, `666`, `662`) — use bitwise check: `(mode & 0o022) != 0`
- **Severity:** MEDIUM — loose permissions let other users on the system read your tokens

### Step 7 — Plaintext Secrets Scan

- **Check:** scan all string values in the JSON for keys named `password`, `secret`, `apiKey`, `api_key`, `privateKey`, `private_key` (case-insensitive) that contain a non-empty string value
- **PASS** if no such keys are found
- **WARN** if such keys exist — remind the user to consider using environment variables or a secrets manager
- **Note:** `token` under `gateway.auth` is expected and should NOT be flagged
- **Note:** Channel-specific tokens like `botToken` (Telegram) SHOULD be flagged as WARN — they are required for operation but are high-value targets if the config leaks
- **Severity:** MEDIUM — plaintext secrets in config files can be leaked through backups, logs, or version control

### Step 8 — Reverse Proxy (trustedProxies)

- **Path:** `gateway.trustedProxies`
- **Context:** When Clawdbot sits behind nginx, Caddy, or any reverse proxy on the same machine, all connections appear to come from 127.0.0.1. Without `trustedProxies`, the gateway treats every proxied request as a local client and skips auth.
- **PASS** if `trustedProxies` is a non-empty array (proxy IPs are explicitly listed)
- **PASS** if `trustedProxies` is absent or empty AND bind is `"loopback"` — print as: `✅ PASS — no proxy, bind is loopback (set trustedProxies if you add one later)`
- **WARN** if `trustedProxies` is absent or empty AND bind is NOT `"loopback"` (e.g., `"0.0.0.0"`) — the gateway is network-exposed and any proxy can spoof local access
- **Fix:** Ask the user for their proxy IP(s) and set:
  ```json
  { "gateway": { "trustedProxies": ["127.0.0.1"] } }
  ```
- **Severity:** CRITICAL — this is the #1 real-world exploit vector (CVE-2025-49596)

### Step 9 — Tailscale Exposure

- **Path:** `gateway.tailscale.mode`
- **Expected:** `"off"`
- **PASS** if the value is `"off"` or the key is absent
- **WARN** if the value is anything other than `"off"` (e.g., `"on"`, `"auto"`) — the gateway becomes reachable by all devices on the tailnet
- **Fix:** Set `gateway.tailscale.mode` to `"off"`:
  ```json
  { "gateway": { "tailscale": { "mode": "off" } } }
  ```
- **Severity:** HIGH — tailnet exposure means any device on your Tailscale network can reach the gateway

### Step 10 — Directory Permissions

- **Check:** file mode of the `~/.clawdbot/` directory itself
- Run: `stat -f '%Lp' ~/.clawdbot/` (macOS) or `stat -c '%a' ~/.clawdbot/` (Linux)
- **Expected:** `700` (owner only)
- **PASS** if permissions are `700`
- **WARN** if permissions are `755` or `750` — other users can list filenames inside
- **FAIL** if permissions are `777` or anything world-writable
- **Fix:** Run:
  ```bash
  chmod 700 ~/.clawdbot/
  ```
- **Severity:** MEDIUM — even if individual files are 600, a listable directory leaks filenames and structure to other users on the system. Infostealers (RedLine, Lumma, Vidar) specifically target `~/.clawdbot/`.

### Step 11 — Browser Control Exposure

- **Path:** `browser.controlUrl` and `browser.controlToken`
- **Context:** Clawdbot can remote-control a browser. If `controlUrl` is set but `controlToken` is missing, anyone who knows the URL can hijack the browser session.
- Also check `gateway.controlUi.allowInsecureAuth` — if `true`, token auth is allowed over plain HTTP (tokens can be sniffed).
- **PASS** if `browser.controlUrl` is absent (browser control not configured)
- **PASS** if `browser.controlUrl` is set AND `browser.controlToken` is also set
- **FAIL** if `browser.controlUrl` is set but `browser.controlToken` is missing or empty
- **WARN** if `gateway.controlUi.allowInsecureAuth` is `true` — tokens sent over HTTP can be intercepted
- **Note:** If both FAIL (missing token) and WARN (insecureAuth) trigger, report as 1 item with the highest severity (FAIL). Fix both.
- **Fix:** Set a control token:
  ```bash
  openssl rand -hex 24
  ```
  Write the output into `browser.controlToken`. If `allowInsecureAuth` is true, set it to false:
  ```json
  { "gateway": { "controlUi": { "allowInsecureAuth": false } } }
  ```
- **Severity:** HIGH — browser control without auth allows remote UI takeover and access to any logged-in sessions

### Step 12 — Logging Redaction

- **Path:** `logging.redactSensitive`
- **Expected:** `"tools"` (the only safe value besides being absent)
- **Valid values:** `"off"` or `"tools"` — there is no `"all"` option
- **PASS** if the value is `"tools"` or the key is absent (default is `"tools"`)
- **WARN** if the value is `"off"` — sensitive tool output (API keys, tokens, credentials) will appear in plaintext in session logs
- **Fix:** Set `logging.redactSensitive` to `"tools"`:
  ```json
  { "logging": { "redactSensitive": "tools" } }
  ```
- **Severity:** MEDIUM — with redaction off, any secret that passes through a tool call gets logged in plaintext at `~/.clawdbot/logs/`

## Output format

After completing all checks, output a report in this exact format:

```
🔒 Security Check Report

 1. Gateway Bind        <ICON> <STATUS> — <detail>
 2. Gateway Auth        <ICON> <STATUS> — <detail>
 3. Token Strength      <ICON> <STATUS> — <detail>
 4. DM Policy           <ICON> <STATUS> — <detail>
 5. Group Policy        <ICON> <STATUS> — <detail>
 6. File Permissions    <ICON> <STATUS> — <detail>
 7. Secrets Scan        <ICON> <STATUS> — <detail>
 8. Reverse Proxy       <ICON> <STATUS> — <detail>
 9. Tailscale           <ICON> <STATUS> — <detail>
10. Directory Perms     <ICON> <STATUS> — <detail>
11. Browser Control     <ICON> <STATUS> — <detail>
12. Log Redaction       <ICON> <STATUS> — <detail>

Score: X/12 PASS, Y WARN, Z FAIL
```

Where:
- `<ICON>` is one of: ✅ (PASS), ⚠️ (WARN), ❌ (FAIL), ⏭️ (SKIP)
- `<STATUS>` is one of: `PASS`, `WARN`, `FAIL`, `SKIP`
- `<detail>` is a short explanation (e.g., "loopback", "token mode", "48 chars", "permissions 600")
- SKIP items do not count toward the denominator. If 2 items are skipped, the score line reads `X/10` not `X/12`

## Auto-fix flow

If **any** item is FAIL or WARN, do the following:

1. Show the report first (as above).
2. List each fixable item with a short description of what will be changed.
3. Ask the user: **"Want me to fix these? (yes / no / pick)"**
   - **yes** — fix all FAIL and WARN items automatically, EXCEPT items marked "⚠️ NEEDS EXTRA CONFIRMATION" (#3 Token, #9 Tailscale) — those always require individual yes/no even in "yes" mode.
   - **no** — stop, do nothing.
   - **pick** — let the user choose which items to fix.
4. Apply the fixes (see Fix recipes below). Items marked "NEEDS EXTRA CONFIRMATION" must be confirmed individually before applying.
5. After applying, re-read the config and re-run the full check to confirm everything is PASS.
6. If the config was changed, remind the user: **"Run `clawdbot gateway restart` to apply the new settings."**

### Fix recipes

Use these exact fixes for each item. Edit `~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json` using the edit/write tool.

#### #1 Gateway Bind — FAIL
Set `gateway.bind` to `"loopback"`:
```json
{ "gateway": { "bind": "loopback" } }
```

#### #2 Gateway Auth — FAIL
Set `gateway.auth.mode` to `"token"`. If no token exists yet, also generate one:
```json
{ "gateway": { "auth": { "mode": "token", "token": "<GENERATED>" } } }
```
Generate the token with:
```bash
openssl rand -hex 24
```
That produces a 48-character hex string (192-bit entropy).

#### #3 Token Strength — FAIL / WARN ⚠️ NEEDS EXTRA CONFIRMATION
**Warning:** Replacing the token disconnects ALL paired devices (Telegram, phones, other clients). They will need the new token to reconnect.
Always ask the user before changing: "Replacing the gateway token will disconnect all paired devices. Proceed?"
If confirmed, generate a new token:
```bash
openssl rand -hex 24
```
Write the output into `gateway.auth.token`.

#### #4 DM Policy — FAIL
Set `dmPolicy` to `"pairing"` for each affected channel:
```json
{ "channels": { "<name>": { "dmPolicy": "pairing" } } }
```

#### #5 Group Policy — FAIL
Set `groupPolicy` to `"allowlist"` for each affected channel:
```json
{ "channels": { "<name>": { "groupPolicy": "allowlist" } } }
```

#### #6 File Permissions — FAIL / WARN
Run:
```bash
chmod 600 ~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json
```

#### #7 Secrets Scan — WARN
This one cannot be auto-fixed safely. Instead, list each flagged key and
remind the user:
- Move the value to an environment variable
- Or use a secrets manager
- Reference it in the config as `"$ENV_VAR_NAME"` if the platform supports it

#### #8 Reverse Proxy — WARN
Ask the user: "Are you running a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, etc.) in front of Clawdbot?"
- If yes: ask for the proxy IP(s) and set:
  ```json
  { "gateway": { "trustedProxies": ["127.0.0.1"] } }
  ```
- If no: mark as INFO/acknowledged, no config change needed

#### #9 Tailscale — WARN ⚠️ NEEDS EXTRA CONFIRMATION
**Warning:** Disabling Tailscale cuts off remote access for all tailnet devices.
Always ask the user before changing: "Disabling Tailscale mode means the gateway is no longer reachable from your tailnet. If you need remote access, use SSH tunneling instead. Proceed?"
If confirmed, set `gateway.tailscale.mode` to `"off"`:
```json
{ "gateway": { "tailscale": { "mode": "off" } } }
```

#### #10 Directory Permissions — WARN / FAIL
Run:
```bash
chmod 700 ~/.clawdbot/
```

#### #11 Browser Control — FAIL / WARN
If `controlToken` is missing, generate and set one:
```bash
openssl rand -hex 24
```
Write into `browser.controlToken`.
If `allowInsecureAuth` is true, set to false:
```json
{ "gateway": { "controlUi": { "allowInsecureAuth": false } } }
```

#### #12 Logging Redaction — WARN
Set `logging.redactSensitive` to `"tools"`:
```json
{ "logging": { "redactSensitive": "tools" } }
```

### Important rules for auto-fix

- **Always back up first.** Before writing any changes, copy the original:
  ```bash
  cp ~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json ~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json.bak
  ```
- **Merge, don't overwrite.** Read the full JSON, modify only the specific
  keys, write back the complete JSON. Never lose existing settings.
- **Preserve formatting.** Write the JSON with 2-space indentation.
- **One write operation.** Collect all JSON fixes, apply them in a single
  write to avoid partial states.
- **Token replacement requires restart.** If the gateway token was changed,
  the user must update any paired clients with the new token.
  Warn: "Your gateway token was changed. Any paired devices will need the
  new token to reconnect."

## What this skill does NOT check

- Sandbox configuration (not needed for most setups)
- Network isolation / Docker (macOS native setups don't use it)
- MCP tool permissions (too complex for a basic audit)
- Whether your OS firewall is configured
- Whether your agent code has vulnerabilities

For a more comprehensive audit, see community tools like `clawdbot-security-check`.

## Reference
