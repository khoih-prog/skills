# Challenges and Mitigations for Polymarket Bot Skill

## Overview
This reference outlines potential challenges in building and running a Polymarket bot, along with mitigations based on the SOP. It's designed to help users anticipate and handle common issues for smoother bot operation.

## Key Challenges and Mitigations
1. **Rate Limits on APIs**: Polymarket APIs may have limits on requests; add delays (e.g., 5-10 seconds between polls) and implement exponential backoff in scripts.
   - Mitigation: Use asyncio for efficient, non-blocking requests, and monitor API usage in `bot_integration.py`.

2. **Trading Fees and Slippage**: Fees (e.g., 2%) and slippage can eat into profits.
   - Mitigation: Factor fees into strategy logic in `strategy_logic.py`, set minimum profit thresholds, and test in dry-run mode.

3. **Blockchain Delays and Gas Fees**: Polygon network can have gas spikes, delaying trades.
   - Mitigation: Use low-gas times (e.g., off-peak hours), monitor gas prices with Web3.py, and include error handling for failed transactions.

4. **API Errors and Invalid Signatures**: Authentication failures or invalid EIP-712 signatures can halt the bot.
   - Mitigation: Add robust error handling in `auth_setup.py`, use secure environment variables for private keys, and log errors for debugging.

5. **Security Risks**: Hardcoding keys or exposing credentials.
   - Mitigation: Store sensitive data in .env files, use libraries like dotenv, and never commit secrets to repositories.

6. **Scaling and Performance**: Monitoring multiple markets can overwhelm resources.
   - Mitigation: Use multiprocessing or asyncio for concurrency, and limit the number of markets in `bot_integration.py`.

## Best Practices
- Test thoroughly in dry-run mode before live trading.
- Monitor bot performance with logging and alerts.
- Regularly review and update the bot based on Polymarket's API changes.

This reference ensures the skill is robust and user-friendly for handling real-world bot development challenges.
