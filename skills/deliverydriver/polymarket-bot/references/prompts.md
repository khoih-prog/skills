# Prompts for Polymarket Bot Skill

## Overview
This reference consolidates the example prompts from the SOP for generating code and strategies using an AI code generator (e.g., Grok or ChatGPT). These prompts help build or extend the bot's functionality in a modular way.

## Consolidated Prompts
1. **Data Fetching Module Prompt**:
   "Write a Python script using requests library to fetch active markets from Polymarket's Gamma API. Include functions to list markets with filters for active=true, closed=false, and limit=20. Parse the JSON response to extract market ID, question, outcomes, and current prices. Add error handling for API failures. Output the data in a pandas DataFrame for easy analysis."

2. **Authentication Setup Prompt**:
   "Create a Python function using web3.py to authenticate with Polymarket's CLOB API. Take a private key as input, sign an EIP-712 message to derive API key, secret, and passphrase. Include code to initialize a trading client. Handle proxy wallet if using Gnosis Safe."

3. **Strategy Logic Prompt**:
   "Build a Python class for a Polymarket arbitrage bot. It should poll a specific market every 10 seconds using the CLOB API for prices. If YES price + NO price < 0.98, buy equal amounts of both, then sell the losing side when conditions are met. Include position limits and logging. Use asyncio for concurrency."

4. **Full Bot Integration Prompt**:
   "Combine the above into a complete Python script for a Polymarket trading bot. Load environment variables for private key. Run an infinite loop to monitor markets, execute strategies, and handle notifications. Add backtesting mode using historical data."

5. **Advanced Features Prompt**:
   "Extend the Polymarket bot to include copy trading. Fetch the leaderboard, select top traders, and mirror their trades with a proportional amount. Include filters and risk management."

## How to Use These Prompts
- Copy and paste a prompt into an AI code generator to produce Python code.
- Test the generated code in the skill's scripts and integrate it iteratively.
- Refer to `strategy_examples.md` for additional context on implementation.

This ensures the skill supports easy code generation and extension based on the SOP.
