# Web Monitor Pro

Watch any web page. Know when it changes.

## Quick Start

```bash
python3 scripts/monitor.py setup
python3 scripts/monitor.py watch "https://example.com/product"
python3 scripts/monitor.py check
```

## What It Does

- Monitors web pages for content changes, price drops, and restocks
- Smart change summaries ("Price dropped from $389 to $331, 15% off")
- Visual side-by-side diffs showing exactly what changed
- Price history tracking with trends and sparklines
- Price comparison across multiple stores
- Templates for common setups (price drop, restock, sale)
- JS rendering via Playwright for dynamic sites
- Webhooks to Slack, Discord, or any endpoint
- Groups, notes, snapshots, exports
- No API keys. Data in `~/.web-monitor/`. Uses `curl` by default.

## Smart Watch

The easiest way to start. Point it at a URL and it figures out the rest.

```bash
python3 scripts/monitor.py watch "https://example.com/product"
```

It detects whether it's a product page (sets up price monitoring), a stock page (watches availability), or a regular page (tracks content). No flags needed.

Add options if you want more control:

```bash
python3 scripts/monitor.py watch "https://example.com" --group wishlist
python3 scripts/monitor.py watch "https://example.com" --browser --webhook "https://hooks.slack.com/..."
```

## Adding Monitors

When you want full control, use `add`:

```bash
python3 scripts/monitor.py add "https://example.com/product" \
  --label "Cool Gadget" \
  --condition "price below 500" \
  --interval 360 \
  --group "wishlist" \
  --priority high \
  --target 3000 \
  --browser \
  --webhook "https://hooks.slack.com/..."
```

**All options** (work with both `add` and `watch`):

- `--label/-l` name for the monitor
- `--selector/-s` CSS selector to focus on (`#price`, `.stock-status`)
- `--condition/-c` when to alert (see Condition Syntax below)
- `--interval/-i` check interval in minutes (default: 360)
- `--group/-g` category name ("wishlist", "work")
- `--priority/-p` high, medium, or low (default: medium)
- `--target/-t` price target number
- `--browser/-b` use Playwright for JS-rendered pages
- `--webhook/-w` webhook URL, repeatable for multiple endpoints

## Checking Monitors

```bash
python3 scripts/monitor.py check                # check all
python3 scripts/monitor.py check --id 3          # check one
python3 scripts/monitor.py check --verbose       # include content preview
```

Returns status (changed/unchanged), condition info, price data, and a human-readable change summary. Examples of what summaries look like:

- "Price dropped from $389 to $331 (15% off). Lowest price in 30 days."
- "Back in stock! Was out of stock for 3 days."
- "New content: 'Breaking news: AI model achieves...'"

When changes are detected, an HTML diff is auto-generated. The path appears in the `diff_path` field.

## Dashboard

Everything at a glance.

```bash
python3 scripts/monitor.py dashboard
python3 scripts/monitor.py dashboard --whatsapp
```

Shows status icons, last check time, days monitored, current prices, target progress, and browser/webhook config. Groups monitors by category.

## Price Trends

```bash
python3 scripts/monitor.py trend 3
python3 scripts/monitor.py trend 3 --days 30
```

Shows direction (rising/dropping/stable), min/max/avg with dates, target progress, and a sparkline.

## Price Comparison

Compare prices across stores in a group:

```bash
python3 scripts/monitor.py compare mygroup
python3 scripts/monitor.py compare --all
```

Shows cheapest to most expensive, price history, and the best deal as a percentage below average.

Add a competitor to an existing monitor:

```bash
python3 scripts/monitor.py add-competitor 3 "https://competitor.com/same-product"
```

Creates a new monitor in the same group with the same condition.

## Templates

Pre-built setups for common patterns. Skip the manual config.

```bash
python3 scripts/monitor.py template list
python3 scripts/monitor.py template use price-drop "https://example.com/product"
python3 scripts/monitor.py template use restock "https://example.com/product"
python3 scripts/monitor.py template use sale "https://example.com/deals"
```

Available templates:

- `price-drop` watches for price decreases, snapshots current price as baseline
- `restock` looks for "in stock", "available", "add to cart"
- `content-update` tracks page changes with smart diff
- `sale` watches for "sale", "discount", "% off"
- `new-release` watches for new items or versions

Each one pre-configures the condition, interval, and priority.

## Managing Monitors

```bash
python3 scripts/monitor.py list                    # all monitors
python3 scripts/monitor.py list --group wishlist   # filter by group
python3 scripts/monitor.py pause 3                 # skip during checks
python3 scripts/monitor.py resume 3                # re-enable
python3 scripts/monitor.py remove 3                # delete
```

## Notes and Snapshots

Attach notes to any monitor:

```bash
python3 scripts/monitor.py note 3 "waiting for Black Friday"
python3 scripts/monitor.py notes 3
```

Take a manual snapshot:

```bash
python3 scripts/monitor.py snapshot 3
python3 scripts/monitor.py snapshot 3 --note "price before sale"
```

View history:

```bash
python3 scripts/monitor.py history 3
python3 scripts/monitor.py history 3 --limit 10
```

## Visual Diffs

Side-by-side HTML comparison. Old on the left, new on the right. Green for additions, red for removals, yellow for changes.

```bash
python3 scripts/monitor.py diff 3
python3 scripts/monitor.py screenshot 3
```

`diff` generates the comparison and opens it in your browser. `screenshot` saves the current content for future diffing.

## Reports

Weekly summary, formatted for WhatsApp:

```bash
python3 scripts/monitor.py report
```

## Groups

```bash
python3 scripts/monitor.py groups
```

Lists all groups with monitor counts.

## Engines and Cloudflare Support

The monitor uses a fetch engine to grab page content. By default (`--engine auto`), it tries engines in order until one works:

1. **curl** -- fast, no dependencies, works on most sites
2. **cloudscraper** -- handles Cloudflare JS challenges without a full browser
3. **playwright** -- full headless browser for JS-heavy SPAs

Check what's available on your system:

```bash
python3 scripts/monitor.py engines
```

Force a specific engine:

```bash
python3 scripts/monitor.py watch "https://example.com" --engine cloudscraper
python3 scripts/monitor.py add "https://example.com" --engine browser
```

Install cloudscraper (recommended for Cloudflare-protected e-commerce sites):

```bash
pip3 install cloudscraper
```

The engine preference is saved per monitor. You can mix engines across monitors.

## JS Rendering

Sites like Amazon, Best Buy, and most SPAs load content with JavaScript. Default `curl` fetching won't see it. Add `--browser` to use Playwright's headless Chromium:

```bash
python3 scripts/monitor.py watch "https://amazon.com/dp/B0EXAMPLE" --browser
```

If Playwright isn't installed, it falls back to `curl` and warns you. Install with:

```bash
pip3 install playwright && python3 -m playwright install chromium
```

## Webhooks

Fire a JSON POST when conditions are met or content changes:

```bash
python3 scripts/monitor.py add "https://example.com" --webhook "https://hooks.slack.com/services/..."
```

Use `--webhook` multiple times for multiple endpoints. The payload includes monitor_id, label, url, event details (status, condition_met, change_summary, current_price), and timestamp.

Webhooks fire during `check` whenever something triggers.

## Export and Import

```bash
python3 scripts/monitor.py export > monitors.json
python3 scripts/monitor.py import monitors.json
```

Import skips duplicates by URL.

## GUI Console

```bash
python3 scripts/monitor.py gui
```

Opens `~/.web-monitor/console.html` in your browser. Single self-contained HTML file. Shows all monitors, price trends, alert history, groups, and templates. Dark/light mode, filtering, sorting, sparklines. No external dependencies.

Add `--no-open` to generate without launching.

## Condition Syntax

- `price below 500` or `price < 500` alerts when price drops below threshold
- `price above 1000` or `price > 1000` alerts when price exceeds threshold
- `contains 'in stock'` alerts when text appears on page
- `not contains 'out of stock'` alerts when text disappears

## Priority Levels

- **high** fires an immediate alert
- **medium** is the default
- **low** gets batched into digests

## Automation with Cron

Set up a cron job to check monitors regularly:

```
Task: Check all web monitors. Run: python3 <skill_dir>/scripts/monitor.py check
Report any monitors where status is "changed" or "condition_met" is true.
If nothing changed, stay silent.
```

Recommended schedule: every 6 hours (`0 */6 * * *`). For weekly reports, run `report` on Mondays.

## Feedback

```bash
python3 scripts/monitor.py feedback "your message"
python3 scripts/monitor.py feedback --bug "something broke"
python3 scripts/monitor.py feedback --idea "wouldn't it be cool if..."
python3 scripts/monitor.py debug
```

## Tips

- `watch` is almost always the right starting point. Use `add` only when you need specific conditions.
- `--selector` reduces noise. If you only care about the price, point it at `#price` instead of the whole page.
- Group related monitors, then use `compare` to find the best deal across stores.
- Up to 50 snapshots per monitor are kept. Content is capped at 10KB per snapshot.
- Price targets show progress in both `dashboard` and `check` output.
- `snapshot --note` before a sale event gives you a clean baseline to diff against.
- For JS-heavy sites, `--browser` is not optional. It's required.
- Combine webhooks with Slack or Discord for real-time alerts without polling.
