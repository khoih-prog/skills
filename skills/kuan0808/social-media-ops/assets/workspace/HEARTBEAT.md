# HEARTBEAT.md — Leader Periodic Checks

_Run these during heartbeat polls. Keep it small to limit token burn._

## Every Heartbeat
- [ ] Check for stale `[PENDING APPROVAL]` items (>48h) — flag to owner
- [ ] Verify today's memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md exists — create if missing
- [ ] Read SCRATCH.md — any interrupted tasks to resume?
- [ ] Verify brand-registry.md is in sync with actual brand directories

## 2-4x Daily (Rotate)
- [ ] Check social notifications/mentions needing response

## Weekly (Sunday)
- [ ] Review daily memory files → update MEMORY.md
- [ ] Check shared/ files for outdated information
- [ ] Review agent performance — any tuning notes?
- [ ] Check brand profiles for completion — flag any that are still template-only

_If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK. Don't fabricate work._
