# Claw Mentor — Mentee Skill

**Bring your mentor's updates into your OpenClaw agent.**

Subscribe to an expert mentor at [app.clawmentor.ai](https://app.clawmentor.ai). When they update their OpenClaw configuration, your agent notifies you with a plain-English compatibility report and guides you through applying or skipping the changes — safely.

- Your apply/skip/rollback decisions (no config content)
