# KryptoGO Meme Trader Agent Skill

## Overview

This skill enables an AI agent to **autonomously analyze and trade** meme coins through the KryptoGO platform. It combines deep on-chain cluster analysis with automated trade execution.

**Analysis** (multi-chain: Solana, BSC, Base, Monad):
- Wallet clustering — identify entities controlling multiple addresses
- Accumulation/distribution detection — who's buying vs. selling
- Address behavior labels — smart money, whales, snipers, developers
- Network-wide accumulation signals (Pro/Alpha tier)

**Trading** (Solana only):
- Portfolio monitoring with per-token PnL tracking
- Automated swap execution via DEX aggregator
- Local transaction signing (private key never leaves the machine)

**Important:** Analysis supports Solana, BSC, Base, and Monad. Trading (swap/submit) is Solana-only.

**Workflow:** discover signal → analyze token → assess risk → execute trade → monitor position.

---

## When to Use

- User asks to analyze a meme coin or token on Solana/BSC/Base/Monad
- User asks to trade, buy, or sell tokens
- User asks to scan for trending tokens or market opportunities
- User asks to monitor portfolio positions or check PnL
- Heartbeat/cron-triggered periodic portfolio monitoring and signal scanning
- Pro/Alpha subscribers leveraging signal dashboard for curated accumulation signals

## When NOT to Use

- BTC, ETH, or major L1 token macro analysis (not meme-specific)
- NFT-related questions
- Cross-chain bridging or non-DEX transactions
- General crypto news or price predictions without on-chain analysis
- Non-Solana trading execution

---

## Setup Flow

### 1. Get API Key

1. Go to [kryptogo.xyz/account](https://www.kryptogo.xyz/account) and create an API key
2. Add it to `~/.openclaw/workspace/.env` (the workspace root `.env`):
   ```bash
   echo 'KRYPTOGO_API_KEY=sk_live_YOUR_KEY' >> ~/.openclaw/workspace/.env && chmod 600 ~/.openclaw/workspace/.env
   ```
3. Tell the agent "I've set my API key in .env" — the agent will verify it works by calling `/agent/account`

> **Do NOT paste your API key directly in chat.** Chat histories may be stored and could expose your key. Always set secrets via `.env` file or environment variables.
>
> All credentials are stored in `~/.openclaw/workspace/.env` — the OpenClaw workspace root. This ensures heartbeat/cron sessions can find them automatically.
>
> The API key is tied to your KryptoGO account (for billing/tier), NOT to a specific wallet.
> Your login wallet on kryptogo.xyz may differ from the agent's trading wallet.

### 2. Generate Agent Wallet

Run the setup script to create a dedicated Solana keypair:

```bash
python3 scripts/setup.py
```

This will:
1. Check Python 3.10+ and install `solders` + `requests` if missing
2. Generate a new Solana keypair
3. Save the private key (base58) and public address to `~/.openclaw/workspace/.env`
4. Set `.env` permissions to 600 (owner read/write only)
5. Print the public address for the user to fund with SOL

### 3. Fund the Wallet

Send SOL to the agent's public address (minimum 0.1 SOL for gas + trading capital).

### Security Rules

- **NEVER** print, log, or include the private key in any message or CLI argument
- **NEVER** accept secrets (API keys, private keys) pasted directly in chat — instruct users to set them in `.env`
- **NEVER** commit `.env` to version control
- **NEVER** use the Read tool on `~/.openclaw/workspace/.env` — load credentials via `source` command only, which doesn't expose values in tool output
- The private key stays in memory only during local signing — it is never sent to any server
- `.env` must always have chmod 600
- See [Safety Guardrails](#safety-guardrails) for full credential handling and trading limits

### Quickstart Checklist

After installing this skill, complete these steps in order:

1. [ ] Get API key from [kryptogo.xyz/account](https://www.kryptogo.xyz/account) and add it to `.env`
2. [ ] Run `python3 scripts/setup.py` to generate agent wallet
3. [ ] Fund the agent wallet with SOL (min 0.1 SOL)
4. [ ] Tell the agent your trading preferences (max position size, risk tolerance, etc.)
5. [ ] Set up periodic monitoring — see [Heartbeat & Cron Integration](#heartbeat--cron-integration)

---

## Authentication

All endpoints require Bearer token authentication:

```
Authorization: Bearer sk_live_<48 hex chars>
```

Some features (signal dashboard, KOL finder) additionally require Pro or Alpha tier subscription.

| Tier  | Daily API Calls | Trading Fee | Signal Dashboard | KOL Finder |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|------------------|------------|
| Free  | 50 calls/day    | 1%          | No               | No         |
| Pro   | 500 calls/day   | 0.5%        | Yes              | Yes        |
| Alpha | 5,000 calls/day | 0%          | Yes              | Yes        |

---

## Agent Behavior

### Session Initialization

On every session start (including heartbeat/cron), the agent MUST load credentials before making any API calls:

```bash
source ~/.openclaw/workspace/.env
```

This makes `KRYPTOGO_API_KEY`, `SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY`, and `SOLANA_WALLET_ADDRESS` available as environment variables. Do NOT use the Read tool on `.env` — the `source` command loads values without exposing them in tool output.

### Autonomous Mode (Default)

**Automatic actions (no user confirmation needed):**
- Scanning trending tokens (default: top 10 per scan)
- Running full analysis pipeline on candidate tokens
- Checking portfolio status and PnL
- Executing trades that pass ALL criteria in the Bullish Checklist
- Stop-loss sells when unrealized loss exceeds threshold
- Take-profit sells when gain exceeds target

**Requires user confirmation:**
- Risk level is "medium" (ambiguous signals)
- Position size exceeds user-defined max
- Selling at a loss outside stop-loss rules
- Any action outside the defined entry/exit strategies

**Reporting:**
- After each trade: summarize analysis result + trade details to the user (concise text, not raw JSON)
- After each scan: brief summary of tokens scanned, why they passed/failed
- On errors: report the issue and suggest next steps

### User Preferences

The user can customize behavior by telling the agent their preferences. Store in `memory/trading-preferences.json`:

```json
{
  "max_position_size": 0.1,
  "max_open_positions": 5,
  "max_daily_trades": 20,
  "stop_loss_pct": 30,
  "take_profit_pct": 100,
  "min_market_cap": 500000,
  "scan_count": 10,
  "risk_tolerance": "moderate",
  "chains": ["solana"]
}
```

| Preference | Default | Description |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| `max_position_size` | 0.1 SOL | Max SOL per trade |
| `max_open_positions` | 5 | Max concurrent open positions |
| `max_daily_trades` | 20 | Max trades per day (buys + sells) |
| `stop_loss_pct` | 30% | Auto-sell when loss exceeds this |
| `take_profit_pct` | 100% | Auto-sell when gain exceeds this |
| `min_market_cap` | $500K | Skip tokens below this market cap |
| `scan_count` | 10 | Number of trending tokens per scan |
| `risk_tolerance` | "moderate" | "conservative" (skip medium risk), "moderate" (ask on medium), "aggressive" (auto-trade medium) |
| `chains` | ["solana"] | Chains to scan for analysis |

---

## Safety Guardrails

This skill handles real funds. These guardrails limit blast radius if credentials are mishandled or the agent malfunctions.

### Credential Isolation

- **API key and private key are stored ONLY in `~/.openclaw/workspace/.env`** with chmod 600 (owner read/write)
- The agent reads credentials via environment variables (`source ~/.openclaw/workspace/.env`) — they are **never** printed, logged, passed as CLI arguments, or included in chat messages
- The agent must **never** use the Read tool on `.env` — the `source` command keeps values out of tool output
- If a user pastes a secret in chat, the agent should warn them and suggest rotating it

### Trading Limits (Hard Caps)

These limits apply even if user preferences set higher values:

| Limit | Default | Can User Override? |
|-------|---------|--------------------|
| Max single trade | 0.1 SOL | Yes, via `max_position_size` in preferences |
| Max concurrent positions | 5 | Yes, via `max_open_positions` (default: 5) |
| Max daily trade count | 20 | Yes, via `max_daily_trades` (default: 20) |
| Price impact abort | >10% | No — always abort |
| Price impact warn | >5% | No — always warn user |

If any limit is hit, the agent **must stop and notify the user** — never silently skip.

### Autonomous Trading Scope

- The agent **only** executes trades that pass ALL criteria in the Bullish Checklist (Step 6)
- Ambiguous signals (risk = "medium") **always** require user confirmation
- The agent **cannot** modify its own trading parameters — only propose changes for user approval
- All trade executions are **immediately reported** to the user via the configured channel (Telegram, Discord, etc.)

### Kill Switch

To immediately stop all autonomous trading:
1. **Remove the Trading Agent section from HEARTBEAT.md** — stops heartbeat-triggered trading
2. **Run `openclaw cron remove <name>`** — stops cron-triggered trading
3. **Remove or rename `.env`** — prevents any API calls or signing

The agent has no persistence mechanism beyond HEARTBEAT.md and cron entries. Removing those stops all autonomous behavior.

### Audit Trail

Every action is logged to `memory/` files (see [Learning Memory Files](#learning-memory-files)):
- `trading-journal.json` — complete trade history with reasoning
- `trading-state.json` — current positions and last scan time
- `trading-lessons.md` — post-mortem analysis

These files are human-readable and can be reviewed at any time.

---

## Heartbeat & Cron Integration

### First-Time Auto-Setup

**Agent instruction:** The first time this skill is loaded in a conversation, check if HEARTBEAT.md already contains a "Trading Agent" section. If not, **proactively offer to add it** — ask the user: "I can set up periodic trading monitoring. Should I add it to your HEARTBEAT.md?" If confirmed, append the heartbeat block below.

> Note: OpenClaw does not auto-modify HEARTBEAT.md on skill install. The agent must do this on first use.

### Heartbeat — Periodic Monitoring (~30 min intervals)

Add the following to your `HEARTBEAT.md`:

```markdown
## Trading Agent
- Check portfolio: call /agent/portfolio, execute stop-loss/take-profit if triggered
- Scan for opportunities: use signal dashboard (Pro/Alpha) or trending tokens API
- Execute qualifying trades in autonomous mode
- Log closed trades to journal, run post-trade reflection, trigger strategy review if due
- ALWAYS report any trade executed to the user — never silent HEARTBEAT_OK after trading
```

**Heartbeat is best for:** 30-minute-level monitoring where slight timing drift is acceptable. Multiple checks (portfolio + scan) batch into a single heartbeat turn, saving API calls.

### Cron — Precise Scheduling (5-15 min intervals)

For more frequent or precisely timed scans, use OpenClaw cron instead of heartbeat:

```bash
# Example: scan every 15 minutes during market hours (UTC)
openclaw cron add --every 15m --name "trading-scan" --prompt "Run the kryptogo-meme-trader scan workflow: check portfolio for stop-loss/take-profit, then scan top 10 trending tokens. Execute qualifying trades. Report any actions taken."

# Example: daily portfolio summary at 9 AM Taipei time (1 AM UTC)
openclaw cron add --cron "0 1 * * *" --name "daily-portfolio" --prompt "Call /agent/portfolio and send me a daily summary of all open positions with PnL."

# List active crons
openclaw cron list

# Remove a cron
openclaw cron remove trading-scan
```

**Cron is best for:** exact timing, high-frequency scans (every 5-15 min), standalone tasks that don't need conversational context, or when you want a different model/thinking level.

**Recommendation:** Use heartbeat for casual monitoring (check every ~30 min). Switch to cron if you want aggressive 5-15 min scan intervals or precise daily reports.

### Heartbeat Workflow

1. **Portfolio check** → Call `/agent/portfolio` with agent's wallet address
   - Execute stop-loss if unrealized loss > `stop_loss_pct`
   - Execute take-profit if unrealized gain > `take_profit_pct`
   - Flag stale positions (held > 7 days with no significant movement)
2. **Signal scan** → Choose source based on subscription tier:
   - **Pro/Alpha tier:** Use `/signal-dashboard` first — these are system-curated accumulation signals (clusters actively buying). Higher quality than raw trending lists because they're pre-filtered for smart money activity. Parameters: `chain_id`, `sort_by=signal_count`, `page_size=10`.
   - **Free tier:** Fall back to `/agent/trending-tokens` with filters (`min_market_cap`, `min_liquidity`, etc.)
   - Run top results through the 7-step analysis pipeline
   - Auto-trade if all criteria pass; ask user if risk = "medium"
3. **State persistence** → Save to `memory/trading-state.json`
   - Tracks: last scan time, open positions, pending user reviews
   - On next session/heartbeat, read this file to resume state
4. **Learning check** → If any trades were closed since last check:
   - Log outcome to `memory/trading-journal.json`
   - Run post-trade reflection (mandatory for every closed trade)
   - If loss >20%, trigger Loss Post-Mortem
   - If 20+ trades accumulated or 7+ days since last review, trigger Strategy Review

### Notification Rules

**Mandatory — agent MUST message the user (never silent HEARTBEAT_OK) when:**
- Any trade is executed (buy or sell)
- A stop-loss or take-profit is triggered
- A position is flagged for manual review (medium risk, stale, etc.)
- An error prevents normal operation (API down, insufficient SOL, quota exceeded)

**Silent HEARTBEAT_OK is OK when:**
- Portfolio checked, no action needed
- Tokens scanned, none qualified
- Everything nominal

### Failure Recovery

If the agent crashes or session ends mid-trade:
- On startup, **ALWAYS** call `/agent/portfolio` first to check current holdings
- Compare with `memory/trading-state.json` to detect any untracked positions
- Report any discrepancies to the user immediately

## On-Chain Analysis Framework (7-Step Pipeline)

### Step 1: Token Overview

Call `/token-overview?address=<mint>&chain_id=<id>` — get name, price, market cap, holders, risk_level, liquidity.

**Filter:** Skip if market cap < user's `min_market_cap`.

### Step 2: Cluster Analysis

Call `/analyze/<mint>?chain_id=<id>` — get wallet clusters, top holders, address metadata.

**Key metric — Cluster Holding Ratio:**
- ≥30-35% = "controlled" — a major entity holds significant supply
- ≥50% = highly concentrated — high manipulation risk
- <10% = dispersed — no clear major holder

**Scam rule:** If a SINGLE cluster holds >50% of supply → skip (rug pull risk).

### Step 3: Cluster Trend

Call `/analyze-cluster-change/<mint>` — get ratio changes across 15m/1h/4h/1d/7d.

**Core insight:** Price and cluster holdings DIVERGING is the most important signal.
- Rising price + falling cluster % = distribution (bearish)
- Falling price + rising cluster % = accumulation (bullish)

### Step 4: Address Labels

Call `/token-wallet-labels` for token-specific labels (developer, sniper, bundle, new_wallet).
Call `/wallet-labels` for behavior labels (smart_money, whale, blue_chip_profit, high_frequency).

**Check sell pressure:** Developer/sniper/bundle still holding = high dump risk.

### Step 5: Deep Dive (Optional)

- `/balance-history` — time-series balance for specific wallets
- `/balance-increase/<mint>` — who bought most in a time range
- `/top-holders-snapshot/<mint>` — point-in-time holder snapshot
- `/analyze-dca-limit-orders/<mint>` — DCA/limit order detection (Solana only)
- `/cluster-wallet-connections` — fund flow between wallets

### Step 6: Decision

Apply the Bullish Checklist from the Decision Framework:
- Market cap ≥ $500K
- Cluster ratio ≥ 30% and rising
- Smart money/whale clusters increasing
- Developer/sniper/bundle positions cleared
- No high proportion of new wallets or high-frequency traders

> Full decision framework: see `references/decision-framework.md`

### Step 7: Execute Trade

If all checks pass:
1. `POST /agent/swap` — build unsigned transaction
2. Sign locally with `solders` (private key never sent to server)
3. `POST /agent/submit` — submit signed transaction
4. Verify via explorer URL

---

## Learning & Adaptation

The agent improves over time by recording every trade, analyzing outcomes, and adjusting its strategy based on accumulated experience.

### Trade Journal

Every trade (buy or sell) MUST be logged to `memory/trading-journal.json` immediately after execution:

```json
{
  "trades": [
    {
      "id": "2026-02-25T14:30:00Z_BONK",
      "token_mint": "DezXAZ8z7PnrnRJjz3wXBoRgixCa6xjnB7YaB1pPB263",
      "symbol": "BONK",
      "chain_id": "501",
      "action": "BUY",
      "amount_sol": 0.1,
      "token_amount": 150000000,
      "price_at_entry": 0.0000234,
      "market_cap_at_entry": 1500000,
      "timestamp": "2026-02-25T14:30:00Z",
      "entry_reasoning": {
        "cluster_ratio": 0.35,
        "cluster_change_1d": 0.05,
        "smart_money_count": 3,
        "dev_exited": true,
        "sniper_cleared": true,
        "signal_source": "signal_dashboard",
        "risk_level": "low"
      },
      "outcome": null
    }
  ]
}
```

When a position is closed (sell), update the corresponding BUY entry's `outcome`:

```json
{
  "outcome": {
    "exit_price": 0.0000468,
    "exit_timestamp": "2026-02-26T09:15:00Z",
    "exit_reason": "take_profit",
    "pnl_sol": 0.1,
    "pnl_pct": 100.0,
    "holding_duration_hours": 18.75,
    "cluster_ratio_at_exit": 0.28,
    "lesson": "Cluster started distributing 2h before exit — could have sold earlier at higher price"
  }
}
```

### Mandatory Post-Trade Reflection

**After every SELL (win or loss), the agent MUST:**

1. Compare the entry reasoning with the actual outcome
2. Identify what the analysis got right and what it missed
3. Write a one-sentence `lesson` in the outcome record
4. If the loss was >20%, do a **Loss Post-Mortem** (see below)

### Loss Post-Mortem

When a trade results in a loss >20%, the agent MUST perform a detailed post-mortem:

1. **Re-run analysis** on the token at current state — what changed since entry?
2. **Identify the miss**: Was it a signal that was there but ignored? An unexpected event? A parameter that was too loose?
3. **Classify the loss type**:
   - `signal_miss` — warning signs existed at entry but weren't weighted enough
   - `timing_error` — analysis was correct but entry/exit timing was wrong
   - `external_event` — unpredictable event (rug pull, exploit, market crash)
   - `parameter_drift` — thresholds were too loose (e.g., accepted low cluster ratio)
   - `overconfidence` — entered despite ambiguous signals
4. **Log to `memory/trading-lessons.md`** with the specific pattern to watch for

### Periodic Strategy Review

**Trigger:** Every 20 trades OR every 7 days (whichever comes first), during a heartbeat/cron cycle.

The agent should:

1. **Calculate aggregate stats** from the journal:
   - Win rate (% of trades with positive PnL)
   - Average win size vs average loss size
   - Best/worst performing entry strategies (signal_dashboard vs trending_tokens)
   - Average holding duration for wins vs losses
   - Most common loss types

2. **Identify patterns**:
   - "Trades entered via signal_dashboard have 65% win rate vs 30% from trending_tokens"
   - "Positions held >24h tend to lose money — meme coins need faster exits"
   - "Tokens with cluster_ratio <25% at entry always lost"

3. **Propose parameter adjustments** to the user:
   - "Based on last 20 trades, I suggest raising `min_market_cap` from $500K to $1M (tokens below $1M had 80% loss rate)"
   - "Stop loss of 30% was never triggered before a 50% drop — consider tightening to 20%"
   - "Take profit at 100% missed several peaks — consider partial exit at 50%"

4. **Save review to `memory/strategy-reviews/YYYY-MM-DD.md`**

5. **Update preferences** only after user approves the proposed changes

### Learning Memory Files

| File | Purpose | Updated |
|------|---------|---------|
| `memory/trading-journal.json` | Every trade with entry reasoning + outcome | After every trade |
| `memory/trading-lessons.md` | Specific patterns learned from losses | After losing trades |
| `memory/strategy-reviews/YYYY-MM-DD.md` | Periodic aggregate analysis | Every 20 trades or 7 days |
| `memory/trading-preferences.json` | Current strategy parameters | When user approves changes |
| `memory/trading-state.json` | Runtime state (open positions, last scan) | After every action |

### Example: Learning in Action

```
Week 1: Agent enters 5 trades using default parameters
  → 2 wins (+80%, +45%), 3 losses (-30%, -25%, -18%)
  → Win rate: 40%, avg win: +62.5%, avg loss: -24.3%

Post-mortem on -30% loss:
  → Token had cluster_ratio 22% at entry (below 30% threshold was relaxed because trending)
  → Lesson: "Never relax cluster_ratio below 25%, even for trending tokens"

Week 2 review:
  → Agent proposes: "Raise min cluster_ratio from 20% to 28%"
  → User approves → preferences updated
  → Agent also notices: "All wins came from signal_dashboard source"
  → Agent proposes: "Allocate 80% of scans to signal_dashboard, 20% to trending"

Week 3: Improved win rate from 40% → 55% with tighter parameters
```

### What the Agent Should NOT Do

- **Never auto-adjust parameters without user approval** — always propose and wait
- **Never delete journal entries** — the full history is needed for pattern analysis
- **Never ignore a post-mortem** — even if the loss was small, the pattern matters
- **Never blame "market conditions"** without specifics — always look for actionable lessons

---

## Best Practices

1. **Always check `/agent/account` first** to confirm tier and remaining quota
2. **Always check `/agent/portfolio` on startup** to detect existing positions
3. **Never expose private keys** in logs, messages, or CLI arguments
4. **Validate price impact** before submitting — abort if >10%, warn if >5%
5. **Sign and submit promptly** — blockhash expires after ~60 seconds
6. **Use stop losses** — meme coins can drop 50%+ in minutes
7. **Persist state** — save trading state to `memory/trading-state.json` after every action
8. **Respect rate limits** — check quota before batch operations
9. **Log every trade to journal** — no exceptions, even failed trades are learning data
10. **Reflect after every exit** — write a lesson, even for wins (what made it work?)
11. **Review and propose, never auto-adjust** — parameter changes require user approval
12. **Read trading-lessons.md before scanning** — avoid repeating known bad patterns

## Core Concepts Quick Reference

| Concept | Key Insight |
|---------|-------------|
| **Cluster** | Group of wallets controlled by same entity, linked by fund flow/timing/transactions |
| **Cluster Ratio** | % of supply held by all clusters. ≥30% = controlled, ≥50% = high risk, <10% = dispersed |
