# Interview Preparation Guide

## Before the Interview

### Company Research Checklist
1. Company mission, values, recent news
2. Product/service — try it yourself if possible
3. Competitors and market position
4. Recent press releases, funding rounds, layoffs
5. Glassdoor reviews (look for patterns, not outliers)
6. LinkedIn: team size, hiring pace, who you'd report to
7. Tech stack / tools they use (from job listing + LinkedIn)

### Prepare Your Stories (STAR Format)
For each key skill in the job listing, prepare a story:
- **S**ituation: Context and background
- **T**ask: Your specific responsibility
- **A**ction: What YOU did (not the team)
- **R**esult: Quantified outcome (%, $, time saved)

### Essential Stories to Have Ready
1. A time you drove measurable growth/improvement
2. A time you handled a difficult stakeholder
3. A time you failed and what you learned
4. A time you worked cross-functionally
5. A time you used data to make a decision
6. Why you left / are leaving your last role (keep positive)

## Common Question Frameworks

### "Tell me about yourself" (2 min max)
Structure: Present → Past → Future
1. Current situation (1 sentence)
2. Relevant experience highlights (3-4 sentences)
3. Why this role excites you (1-2 sentences)

### "Why this company?"
Connect: your values → their mission → specific examples from research

### "What's your salary expectation?"
- Research first (use salary_research.sh)
- Give a range, anchor high
- "Based on my research and experience, I'm looking at €X-Y, but I'm open to discussing the full package"
- Never give a number first if you can avoid it

### "Do you have questions for us?"
Always have 3-5 ready:
1. "What does success look like in the first 90 days?"
2. "What's the biggest challenge the team is facing right now?"
3. "How is performance measured and reviewed?"
4. "What's the team structure and who would I work with most?"
5. "What's something you wish you'd known before joining?"
