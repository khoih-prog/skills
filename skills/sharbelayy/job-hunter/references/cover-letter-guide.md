# Cover Letter & Application Guide

## Cover Letter Structure (250-350 words)

### Paragraph 1: Hook (2-3 sentences)
- Open with something specific about the company (not generic flattery)
- Connect it to your genuine interest
- Mention the role title

### Paragraph 2: Value Proposition (3-4 sentences)
- Your most relevant achievement (quantified)
- How your experience maps to their top 2-3 requirements
- Show you understand their challenges

### Paragraph 3: Cultural Fit (2-3 sentences)
- Why this company specifically (not just the role)
- Something from their values/culture that resonates
- Brief mention of soft skills relevant to the team

### Paragraph 4: Close (1-2 sentences)
- Express enthusiasm for next steps
- Keep it confident but not arrogant

## Tone Guidelines
- Professional but human — no corporate jargon
- Confident, not desperate
- Specific, not generic (every cover letter should feel unique)
- Show personality — you're a person, not a template

## LinkedIn Application Tips
- "Easy Apply" jobs get 100x more applications — stand out by also messaging the recruiter
- Find the hiring manager on LinkedIn, send a brief note
- Personalize the connection request (mention the role)

## Networking Message Template
"Hi [Name], I came across the [Role] position at [Company] and I'm really interested. I noticed you're on the [team] — would love to learn more about the team culture. Happy to chat briefly if you're open to it!"

## Red Flags in Job Listings
- "Fast-paced environment" = potentially chaotic
- "Wear many hats" = under-resourced
- "Competitive salary" with no range = might lowball
- "Family" culture = potential boundary issues
- Fixed-term < 6 months unless strategic
- Requirements listing 15+ skills = they don't know what they want
- "Must have 10 years in a 5-year-old technology"
