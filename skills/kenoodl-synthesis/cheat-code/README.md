# Skill Hunter

Find, evaluate, and install ClawHub skills.

10,000+ skills on ClawHub. No good way to find the right one, vet it, or know if it's safe to install. Skill Hunter fixes that.

## Install

```
clawhub install kenoodl-synthesis/skill-hunter
```

## What it does

- **Semantic search** — describe what you need in plain English, get ranked results
- **Remote inspection** — read any skill's SKILL.md without installing it
- **Security evaluation** — checklist and risk framework before you commit
- **Side-by-side comparison** — compare candidates on trust, adoption, and scope
- **Install management** — install, update, remove

## No credentials required

Skill Hunter uses ClawHub's public API. No accounts, no tokens, no env vars. The agent makes the calls directly.
