  Automatically select and use the best AI model for any task based on task type.
  ALWAYS activate this skill at the start of a new task or when the user asks a
  substantive question. Routes coding tasks to code-specialized models, math to
  reasoning models, translation to multilingual models, casual chat to fast cheap
  models, etc. Learns from user feedback over time when router is configured.
  Trigger phrases: "help me", "write", "code", "debug", "translate", "analyze",
  "summarize", "explain", or any task-oriented request.

# Auto Model Router Skill

You have intelligent model routing. For every substantive task, follow this procedure.

## Task Categories

Classify tasks into one of these categories:

| Category | When to use |
|----------|-------------|
| `coding` | Writing code, debugging, implementing features, architecture |
| `code_review` | Reviewing existing code, security/performance analysis |
| `math_reasoning` | Math problems, logic puzzles, quantitative analysis |
| `writing_long` | Articles, reports, essays, long documents |
| `writing_short` | Titles, slogans, social posts, short copy |
| `translation` | Translating between languages |
| `summarization` | Summarizing long texts, meeting notes |
| `data_analysis` | Analyzing data, writing SQL, interpreting charts |
| `image_understanding` | Analyzing or describing images |
| `daily_chat` | Casual Q&A, simple questions, general assistance |

## Procedure

Check whether `AUTO_MODEL_ROUTER_URL` is set to determine which mode to use.

---

### Mode A — Local (default, no router needed)

Use this when `AUTO_MODEL_ROUTER_URL` is NOT set.

**Step 1 — Classify the task yourself**

Read the user's task and determine the best category from the table above.
Be decisive — pick one category.

**Step 2 — Call the model**

```
python3 ~/.claude/skills/auto-model-router/scripts/call_model.py "<category>" "<user task text>"
```

Exit codes:
- `3` — API key missing: tell the user which env var to set
- `4` — Config not found: tell the user to run `python3 scripts/setup.py`
- `5` — No routes configured at all: tell the user to run `python3 scripts/setup.py`

**Step 3 — Present the result**

Show the response naturally. Add a subtle footer:
`_[auto-model-router: used {category} → {model}]_`

---

### Mode B — Router (with learning)

Use this when `AUTO_MODEL_ROUTER_URL` is set.

**Step 1 — Get recommendation**

```
python3 ~/.claude/skills/auto-model-router/scripts/recommend.py "<user task text>" "<USER_ID>"
```

- Capture stdout as the model response.
- Extract `TASK_ID` from stderr (line starting with `TASK_ID=`).

Exit codes:
- `2` — Router offline: fall back to Mode A automatically
- `3` — API key missing: tell the user which env var to set

**Step 2 — Present the result**

Same as Mode A Step 3.

**Step 3 — Collect feedback**

Ask once after presenting the result:
> "Was this response helpful? Reply 👍, 👎, or skip."

If 👍:
```
python3 ~/.claude/skills/auto-model-router/scripts/feedback.py "<TASK_ID>" 1 "<USER_ID>"
```

If 👎:
```
python3 ~/.claude/skills/auto-model-router/scripts/feedback.py "<TASK_ID>" -1 "<USER_ID>"
```

If skip, do nothing.

## Changing Model Assignments

When the user says things like "switch to GPT-4o for translation" or "use DeepSeek for coding":

```
python3 ~/.claude/skills/auto-model-router/scripts/update_route.py <category> <provider> <model>
```

Examples:
```
python3 ~/.claude/skills/auto-model-router/scripts/update_route.py translation openai gpt-4o
python3 ~/.claude/skills/auto-model-router/scripts/update_route.py coding deepseek deepseek-chat
python3 ~/.claude/skills/auto-model-router/scripts/update_route.py daily_chat google gemini-2.0-flash
```

Confirm to the user: "Done, {category} tasks will now use {model}."

## First-time Setup

If config is missing, tell the user to run:
```
python3 ~/.claude/skills/auto-model-router/scripts/setup.py
```

## Manual Invocation

`/auto-model-router <your task>`
