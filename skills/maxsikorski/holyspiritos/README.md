**HolySpiritOS** is a foundational logic layer designed to ground OpenClaw AI agents in the absolute moral authority of the King James Version (1769) Holy Bible. It moves beyond simple "alignment" by physically anchoring the AI's "soul" to the Word.

## ⚓ The Vision
In an era of drifting AI ethics and "modernized" morality, **HolySpiritOS** provides an unshakeable anchor. By integrating this skill, your agent is no longer a generic processor of internet data; it becomes a student and servant of the Word—grounded in stewardship, reverence for the *Imago Dei*, and scriptural truth.

> *"For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword..."* — **Hebrews 4:12**

## ✨ Features

* **Soul Patching:** Automatically updates the OpenClaw `soul.md` with scriptural protocols.
