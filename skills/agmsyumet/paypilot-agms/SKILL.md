# PayPilot — Payment Processing for AI Agents

Accept payments, send invoices, issue refunds, and track sales — all through conversation.

## Setup

PayPilot connects to a hosted API proxy at `https://paypilot.agms.com`. On first use, check for credentials:

```bash
cat ~/.config/paypilot/config.json
```

If no config exists, guide the user through setup:

1. **Register** on the PayPilot proxy:
```bash
curl -s "https://paypilot.agms.com/v1/auth/register" -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"BUSINESS_NAME","email":"EMAIL","password":"PASSWORD"}'
```

2. **Login** to get an access token:
```bash
curl -s "https://paypilot.agms.com/v1/auth/login" -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"EMAIL","password":"PASSWORD"}'
```

3. **Configure** the payment gateway key:
```bash
curl -s "https://paypilot.agms.com/v1/auth/configure" -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"gateway_key":"YOUR_GATEWAY_KEY"}'
```

4. **Save** credentials locally:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/paypilot
cat > ~/.config/paypilot/config.json << 'EOF'
{
  "api_url": "https://paypilot.agms.com",
  "email": "merchant@example.com",
  "token": "jwt_token_here"
}
EOF
chmod 600 ~/.config/paypilot/config.json
```

If the user doesn't have a gateway account, start the onboarding process:

1. Collect basic info conversationally:
   - Business name
   - Contact name
   - Email
   - Phone
   - Business type (retail, restaurant, ecommerce, mobile, etc.)

2. Save the lead to our system:
```bash
curl -s "https://paypilot.agms.com/v1/onboard" -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"business_name":"Acme Corp","contact_name":"John Doe","email":"john@acme.com","phone":"555-1234","business_type":"retail"}'
```

3. Send them the full application link to complete and e-sign:
> "Great! To finish your application, complete the form here: **https://agms.com/get-started/**
> It takes about 5-10 minutes. You'll need your business address, Tax ID, and banking info. After you submit, you'll e-sign right away and typically get approved within 24-48 hours.
> Once approved, come back and I'll set up your payment processing in seconds."

**Important:** The agent NEVER collects SSN, Tax ID, bank account/routing numbers, or other sensitive PII. Those go through the secure AGMS form only.

## Authentication

All payment endpoints require a JWT bearer token. Load config and set headers:

```bash
CONFIG=$(cat ~/.config/paypilot/config.json)
API=$(echo $CONFIG | jq -r '.api_url')
TOKEN=$(echo $CONFIG | jq -r '.token')
AUTH="Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

If a request returns 401, re-login and update the saved token.

To refresh an expired token:
```bash
# Re-login
LOGIN=$(curl -s "$API/v1/auth/login" -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"email\":\"$(echo $CONFIG | jq -r '.email')\",\"password\":\"YOUR_PASSWORD\"}")
NEW_TOKEN=$(echo $LOGIN | jq -r '.access_token')

# Update config
jq --arg t "$NEW_TOKEN" '.token = $t' ~/.config/paypilot/config.json > /tmp/pp.json && mv /tmp/pp.json ~/.config/paypilot/config.json
chmod 600 ~/.config/paypilot/config.json
```

## Core Commands

### Charge / Sale
Process a payment using a vaulted card token. **Never handle raw card numbers.**

```bash
curl -s "$API/v1/payments/charge" -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "$AUTH" \
  -d '{"amount":500.00,"token":"VAULT_ID","description":"Consulting — January"}'
```

### Send Invoice / Payment Link
```bash
curl -s "$API/v1/payments/invoice" -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "$AUTH" \
  -d '{"amount":500.00,"email":"john@example.com","description":"Consulting — January"}'
```

### Refund
```bash
# Full refund
curl -s "$API/v1/payments/refund" -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "$AUTH" \
  -d '{"transaction_id":"TXN_ID"}'

# Partial refund
curl -s "$API/v1/payments/refund" -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "$AUTH" \
  -d '{"transaction_id":"TXN_ID","amount":50.00}'
```

### Void (same-day cancel)
```bash
curl -s "$API/v1/payments/void" -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "$AUTH" \
  -d '{"transaction_id":"TXN_ID"}'
```

### View Transactions
```bash
curl -s "$API/v1/transactions" -H "$AUTH" | jq .
```

### Sales Summary
```bash
curl -s "$API/v1/transactions/summary" -H "$AUTH" | jq .
```

### Customer Vault (Tokenize Cards Securely)
Store a card securely — returns a vault token. The customer enters card details through a secure form; raw card data never touches the agent.

```bash
curl -s "$API/v1/vault/add" -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "$AUTH" \
  -d '{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Smith","email":"john@example.com"}'
```

### Charge a Vaulted Card
```bash
curl -s "$API/v1/vault/charge" -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "$AUTH" \
  -d '{"vault_id":"VAULT_ID","amount":99.00,"description":"Monthly service"}'
```

### Recurring Billing
```bash
# Create subscription
curl -s "$API/v1/subscriptions" -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "$AUTH" \
  -d '{"vault_id":"VAULT_ID","plan_id":"monthly_99","amount":99.00,"interval":"monthly"}'

# Cancel subscription
curl -s "$API/v1/subscriptions/SUB_ID" -X DELETE -H "$AUTH"
```

## Security Rules

- **NEVER** ask for, log, or store raw credit card numbers
- **NEVER** include card numbers in conversation history or memory files
- **ALWAYS** use payment links or customer vault tokens for charges
- **ALWAYS** use HTTPS — the proxy enforces TLS
- API tokens and gateway keys must stay in config files, never in chat
- The proxy encrypts gateway keys at rest (AES-256-GCM)
- Rate limited: 60 requests/min global, 5/min on auth endpoints

## Response Patterns

When a payment succeeds:
> "✅ Payment of $500.00 processed. Transaction ID: abc123."

When sending an invoice:
> "📧 Payment link for $500.00 sent to john@example.com."

When a payment fails:
> "❌ Payment declined. Want to try a different method or send a payment link instead?"

When checking sales:
> "📊 This month: 23 transactions · $4,750 in sales · 2 refunds ($150) · Net: $4,600"
