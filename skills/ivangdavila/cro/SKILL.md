## When to Use

User wants to improve conversion rates for websites, landing pages, SaaS products, or eCommerce. Agent runs audits, sets up tests, interprets results, and implements winning variants.

## Quick Reference

| Topic | File |
|-------|------|
| A/B testing methodology | `testing.md` |
| Conversion audits | `audits.md` |
| Legal compliance | `legal.md` |
| Tools & integrations | `tools.md` |

## Core Capabilities

1. **Audit funnels** — Identify drop-off points, quantify revenue impact, prioritize fixes
2. **Run A/B tests** — Generate variants, calculate sample size, monitor significance, call winners
3. **Optimize forms** — Reduce fields, improve flow, track field-level abandonment
4. **Analyze results** — Statistical significance, confidence intervals, segment breakdowns
5. **Monitor anomalies** — Alert on conversion drops, diagnose root causes by segment
6. **Generate copy variants** — Headlines, CTAs, value props using proven frameworks
7. **Speed optimization** — Core Web Vitals impact on conversion, prioritize fixes

## Decision Checklist

Before optimizing, gather:
- [ ] Current conversion rate baseline?
- [ ] Traffic volume (for sample size calc)?
- [ ] Primary conversion goal (purchase, signup, lead)?
- [ ] Access to analytics/testing tools?
- [ ] Regulatory context (EU/GDPR, California/CPRA)?

## Critical Rules

- **Statistical significance first** — Never call a test early; 95% confidence minimum
- **One variable at a time** — Isolate changes to attribute impact correctly
- **Document everything** — Hypothesis, variants, results, learnings
- **Consent before testing** — Most A/B tools need cookie consent in EU
- **No dark patterns** — Fake urgency, confirm-shaming, asymmetric friction are illegal
- **Mobile parity** — Always test mobile variants; don't assume desktop results transfer
