## Common Mistakes

### 1. Only Looking at the 1st District
**Reality:** Extremely expensive, touristy, not real neighborhood life

**Better:** 7th, 8th, 9th for similar charm at half the price

### 2. Choosing Based on Guidebook
**Reality:** Guidebooks focus on tourist areas

**Better:** Visit neighborhoods in person, walk around at different times

### 3. Prioritizing Low Rent Over Quality
**Reality:** €200/month saved isn't worth unhappiness

**Better:** Stretch budget slightly for livability (5th vs 11th)

### 4. Ignoring Transit Lines
**Reality:** A poorly connected flat costs time daily

**Better:** Prioritize U-Bahn access over apartment size

### 5. Not Visiting at Night
**Reality:** Areas feel different after dark

**Better:** Walk the neighborhood at 10pm before signing

## Final Advice

### The "Vienna Formula"

For most newcomers, the best districts are:

1. **7th** — If you can afford it, coolest district
2. **4th** — Excellent alternative, similar vibe
3. **2nd** — Best value for young professionals
4. **9th** — Best for professionals wanting quiet elegance

### The 20-Minute Rule

Most Viennese wisdom: live within 20 minutes of your daily commute. Vienna's transit is excellent, but daily long commutes wear you down.

### The Café Test

Before choosing a neighborhood, find a café and sit for an hour. Watch who walks by. Read the notices. Feel the energy. This tells you more than any listing.
