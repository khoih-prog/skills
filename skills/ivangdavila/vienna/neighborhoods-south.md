## Southern Districts Summary

| District | Best For | Rent | Quality of Life |
|----------|----------|------|-----------------|
| **10th** | Budget, diversity | €11-14 | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **11th** | Very budget | €10-13 | ⭐⭐ |
| **12th** | Families on budget | €11-14 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

### Recommendation

For most newcomers and expats, **avoid 10th and 11th** unless on extremely tight budget. **12th is acceptable** for families prioritizing value over excitement.

If you can stretch budget slightly, the 5th or parts of the 2nd offer better quality of life for only €2-4/m² more.
