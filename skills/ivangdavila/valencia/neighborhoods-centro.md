## Insider Tips

1. **Visit at night before signing lease** — noise levels vary dramatically
2. **Upper floors = quieter** — ground floor on Calle Caballeros = no sleep
3. **Interior apartments** — quieter but darker, trade-off
4. **Ask about "humedades"** — old buildings can have moisture issues
5. **Summer = AC essential** — confirm before signing
6. **Winter = heating needed** — some old buildings don't have it
