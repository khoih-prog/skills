### Paella Rules

1. **Eat it at LUNCH** (13:00-15:30) — Valencians eat paella midday, never dinner
2. **Minimum 2 people** — Not served individually
3. **Order 30-45 min ahead** — Real paella is cooked to order
4. **Eat from the pan** — Traditional style, each person takes their section
5. **The socarrat** — The crispy bottom is the prize, not burnt
