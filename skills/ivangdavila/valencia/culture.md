## Language

### Dual Language Reality

**Castellano (Spanish)**:
- Everyone speaks it
- All business conducted in it
- You'll be fine with just Spanish

**Valenciano (Valencià)**:
- Co-official language
- ~50% of population speaks it
- Used in some government, signage, schools
- Similar to Catalan (mutual intelligibility)

### Language Politics
- Less intense than Catalonia
- Some prefer Valenciano, most don't mind Spanish
- Government documents often bilingual
- Schools: Can choose instruction language
- Speaking Spanish is always accepted

### Learning Spanish
Valencia is excellent for learning:
- Clear Castilian accent (no strong regional dialect)
- Locals patient with learners
- Language schools abundant
- Immersion opportunities

**Basic Valenciano phrases** (not required, but appreciated):
- Bon dia — Good morning
- Gràcies — Thank you
- Adeu — Goodbye
