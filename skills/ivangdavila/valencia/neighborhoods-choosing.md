### Step 3: Budget Reality Check

| Your Budget (1BR) | Realistic Options |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| <€700/month | Patraix, Benimaclet, Algirós |
| €700-900/month | Add: El Cabanyal, Malvarrosa, La Saïdia |
| €900-1,100/month | Add: Eixample, Campanar |
| €1,100-1,400/month | Add: Ruzafa, Centro (outskirts) |
| €1,400+/month | El Carmen, prime Ruzafa, beachfront |

**Note**: These are realistic ranges for decent apartments, not minimum or maximum.

### Step 4: Deal-Breakers

Check your non-negotiables:

- ☐ **Must walk to Centro** → Ruzafa, Eixample, Carmen only
- ☐ **Must have beach nearby** → Beach neighborhoods only
- ☐ **Need absolute quiet** → Avoid Carmen, Ruzafa, Benimaclet center
- ☐ **No car, depend on metro** → Check station proximity carefully
- ☐ **Need modern/new building** → Quatre Carreres, new builds elsewhere
- ☐ **Must have parking** → Suburban neighborhoods better
- ☐ **Kids in school** → Research school locations first

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Choosing El Carmen for "the experience"
**Problem**: Weekend noise is extreme. You'll move within months.
**Solution**: Stay in El Carmen for 2-3 nights before signing anything. Visit at 2am Saturday.

### Mistake 2: Beach neighborhood for daily Centro work
**Problem**: 30-45 min commute each way adds up.
**Solution**: Calculate weekly commute time. Beach is for beach-first lifestyles.

### Mistake 3: Cheapest option without seeing it
**Problem**: Cheap neighborhoods have more variation. Bad blocks exist.
**Solution**: Walk around at different times. See the specific apartment.

### Mistake 4: Ignoring metro access
**Problem**: Some "central" areas have poor connections.
**Solution**: Check actual walking distance to metro stop (Google Maps, not listing claims).

### Mistake 5: Assuming August apartment availability
**Problem**: Owners go on vacation. Viewings difficult.
**Solution**: Search July or September if possible.
