## Skip or Manage Expectations

### Playa de la Barceloneta (Wrong City)
People sometimes confuse with Barcelona's beach. Valencia's beaches are Malvarrosa/Patacona.

### L'Hemisfèric Without a Show
The building is beautiful but going inside without an IMAX showing isn't worth it.

### Torres de Quart
Medieval gate, but you can't climb it. Torres de Serranos is the one for views.

### Most "Tapas Tours"
Overpriced. Better to explore Ruzafa or El Carmen yourself with a food map.

### Museo Fallero
Only interesting if you're obsessed with Fallas. Otherwise skip.

## Best Times to Visit

### Fallas (March 15-19)
Valencia's biggest festival:
- Giant sculptures (fallas) throughout the city
- Fireworks every day at 14:00 (mascletà)
- Burning of fallas on final night
- EXTREMELY crowded, book 3+ months ahead
- Not recommended if you dislike noise or crowds

### Spring (April-May) & Fall (September-October)
- Perfect weather 20-26°C
- Fewer crowds than summer
- All attractions open
- Best for first-time visitors

### Summer (June-August)
- Hot 30-35°C but beach weather
- August: many locals leave, some restaurants close
- Best for beach-focused trips

### Winter (December-February)
- Mild 12-18°C, occasional rain
- Fewer tourists, cheaper hotels
- Christmas markets in December
- February: La Magdalena carnival in nearby Castellón

## Insider Tips

1. **Free Walking Tours**: Daily from Plaza de la Virgen, tip-based

3. **Sunset Spots**: L'Umbracle gardens, Malvarrosa beach, Torres de Serranos

5. **Valencia Card**: Metro + bus + museum discounts, worth it for 2-3 day visits
