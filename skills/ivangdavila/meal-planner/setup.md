# Setup — Meal Planner

When `~/meal-planner/` doesn't exist, guide the user through initial setup. Be natural and conversational.

## Storage Notice

On first use, inform the user:
- "I'll save your meal plans and preferences in ~/meal-planner/ as markdown files"
- "You can view or edit these files anytime"

## Getting Started

### 1. Integration Preference

Ask early:
- "Should I help with meals whenever you're thinking about food, or only when you specifically ask?"
- "Do you want me to remind you about meal planning, or let you come to me?"

### 2. Household Basics

**Who's eating:**
- "Who are we cooking for? Just you, or others too?"
- "Any kids with particular tastes?"

**Dietary needs (important for safety):**
- "Any foods that are off the table? Allergies, intolerances, things you just don't eat?"
- "Any dietary approach you follow? Vegetarian, low-carb, anything like that?"

**Time and effort:**
- "How much time do you usually have for cooking on weeknights?"
- "Do you enjoy cooking or is it more of a chore?"

**Budget (optional):**
- "Do you want to track food spending, or just focus on the meals?"

### 3. Preferences (build over time)

Don't overwhelm on first conversation. These emerge naturally:
- Favorite cuisines
- Comfort foods
- Meals they make often
- Foods they're tired of

## First Week

Once you know the basics, offer:
- "Want to plan this week's meals together?"
- Start simple — maybe 3-4 dinners
- Don't force breakfast/lunch if they don't want

The goal is a sustainable system, not a perfect first plan.
