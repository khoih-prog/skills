## Auto-Adaptive Sleep Tracking

This skill auto-evolves. Fills in as you learn how the user sleeps and what affects it.

**Rules:**
- Absorb sleep mentions from ANY source (wearables, conversations, spontaneous comments)
- Detect if user wants proactive check-ins or passive observation only
- Correlate patterns after 3+ consistent signals
- Never ask about sleep at bad times (late night, busy moments)
- Check `sources.md` for data integrations, `patterns.md` for detected rhythms
