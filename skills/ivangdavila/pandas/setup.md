# Setup — Pandas

Read this when `~/pandas/` doesn't exist. Create the folder and initialize `memory.md`.

## Data Storage

All preferences are stored locally in `~/pandas/memory.md`. Users can view, edit, or delete this file anytime.

## First Conversation

Ask what would help them most:
- Code style preferences (method chaining vs explicit steps)
- Level of intervention (proactive tips vs on-demand)
- Typical data work (time series, transactional, logs)

Save answers to `~/pandas/memory.md` using the template from `memory-template.md`.

## Ongoing Use

- Check `~/pandas/memory.md` at start of each session
- Update preferences when user shares new information
- Provide pandas guidance based on stored context
