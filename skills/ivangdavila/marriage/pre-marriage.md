# Pre-Marriage (Engaged)

Preparing for marriage, not just wedding. Critical conversations before commitment.

## Readiness Assessment

**Questions to explore:**
- Why marriage now vs continuing dating?
- What changes do you expect after marriage?
- What are your non-negotiables?
- Have you seen each other at your worst?

**Red flags vs cold feet:**
- Cold feet: nervousness about change, normal anxiety
- Red flags: fundamental value mismatches, control patterns, feeling trapped

## Essential Conversations

### Money
- Current debts, savings, credit scores (full transparency)
- Who manages what? Joint accounts vs separate?
- Spending thresholds requiring discussion
- Financial goals: house, retirement, lifestyle
- What if one earns significantly more?

### Children
- Do you want kids? How many? When?
- What if fertility issues arise?
- Parenting philosophy basics
- Division of childcare labor expectations
- What if one changes their mind?

### Career & Location
- Whose career takes priority when?
- Open to relocation? Under what circumstances?
- Work-life balance expectations
- What if dream opportunity requires sacrifice?

### Family & Boundaries
- In-law involvement expectations
- Holidays: whose family, how often?
- Supporting aging parents
- What stays between us vs shared with family?

### Division of Labor
- Who does what at home?
- Standards for "clean enough"
- Mental load awareness
- How to renegotiate when life changes?

## Conflict Patterns

**Learn before you marry:**
- How do you each fight? (attack, withdraw, stonewall)
- What triggers escalation?
- How do you repair after conflict?
- Can you disagree and still feel loved?

**Practice now:**
- Disagree on something medium-stakes
- Notice patterns, discuss them afterward
- Establish repair rituals early

## Wedding vs Marriage

**Common trap:** All energy on wedding, none on marriage prep.

**Rebalance:**
- Premarital counseling (secular or religious)
- Stress-test: plan wedding disagreements = preview of conflict style
- Keep perspective: one day vs decades

---

## Individual Identity

**Preserve:**
- Friendships outside the couple
- Hobbies and interests
- Career identity
- Personal growth goals

**Marriage adds, shouldn't erase.**

## When to Pause

Consider delaying if:
- Major unresolved conflicts about kids, money, location
- One partner significantly more enthusiastic
- External pressure driving timeline
- Haven't weathered a real crisis together
- Trust issues unaddressed
