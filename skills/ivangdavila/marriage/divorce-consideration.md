# Considering Divorce

Questioning whether to stay or leave. Need clarity, not judgment.

## The Core Question

**Not "should I divorce?" but:**
- Have I genuinely tried everything I'm capable of?
- Is this fixable, and do both people want to fix it?
- What am I hoping divorce will give me?
- What will divorce actually cost?

**Both staying and leaving can be right choice.**

## Diagnostic Framework

### The Exhaustion Test
**Exhaustion from trying** — May mean wrong approaches, not wrong marriage
**Exhaustion from person** — May indicate fundamental mismatch

### The Contempt Check
**Gottman's #1 predictor of divorce:**
- Do you feel disgust toward partner?
- Do they feel it toward you?
- Can you imagine respecting them again?

**Contempt is hard to reverse. But not impossible.**

### The Future Visualization
- Can you see being happy together in 5 years?
- What would need to change?
- Is that change realistic?
- Do you want it to change, or want out?

## "Have I Really Tried?"

**Actually trying looks like:**
- Couples therapy (right therapist, enough time)
- Individual work on your contribution
- Clear requests, not mind-reading expectations
- Sustained effort (months, not weeks)
- Real vulnerability, not performed effort

**Not trying (but feeling like it):**
- Same fights, no new approaches
- Therapy sabotaged or half-hearted
- Waiting for them to change first
- Internal decision already made

## When Partner Won't Try

**They refuse therapy:**
- Go yourself first
- Written request with stakes clear
- Set internal deadline
- Can't force participation

**They promise, don't deliver:**
- Actions over words
- Pattern recognition
- Clear consequences communicated
- Follow through on those consequences

**You cannot will someone into effort.**

## The Affair Question

**Discovery is crisis, not automatic end:**
- Immediate decisions often regretted
- Can't make permanent choice in acute pain
- Some marriages survive and improve
- Some shouldn't continue regardless

**Questions before deciding:**
- One-time or pattern?
- Full honesty now?
- Remorse vs regret-at-being-caught?
- Willing to do repair work?
- Can you eventually forgive?

**No rush. Big decisions deserve clear head.**

## Kids and Divorce

**Hard truths:**
- Kids adapt to many family structures
- Conflict exposure harms more than divorce itself
- Staying "for the kids" often backfires
- Good divorce beats bad marriage for children
- Co-parenting continues relationship

**If leaving:**
- Age-appropriate honesty
- United front with co-parent
- Reassurance about love for them
- Minimize disruption where possible
- Consider family therapy

---

## Financial Clarity

**Before deciding, understand:**
- Full picture of assets/debts
- Income disparity implications
- Cost of two households
- Legal process costs
- Timeline expectations

**Not about money determining stay/leave, but realistic planning.**

**Get professional consultation (lawyer, financial advisor).**

## The "One More Try" Framework

**If considering last attempt:**
1. Define what "trying" looks like (specific)
2. Agree on timeline (3-6 months)
3. Both commit fully during period
4. Clear success criteria
5. Honest evaluation at end

**Prevents endless limbo.**

## Permission to Leave

**Leaving can be:**
- Healthy choice
- Self-respect
- Best for everyone (including kids)
- Growth, not failure

**You don't need:**
- Abuse to justify leaving
- Affair to justify leaving
- Permission from others
- Anyone else to understand

**Unhappy is enough reason to re-evaluate.**

---

## Emotional Preparation

**Before announcing:**
- Therapy support for yourself
- Trusted confidants (limited)
- Practical logistics researched
- Prepare for range of reactions
- Know your talking points

**After announcing:**
- Allow partner to react
- Don't defend or argue decision
- Discuss logistics separately from emotions
- Expect process, not single conversation

---

## Amicable Divorce

**If both agree to end:**
- Mediation over litigation when possible
- Focus on fair, not winning
- Protect children from conflict
- Build co-parenting foundation
- Grieve while separating

**Divorce ends marriage, not necessarily relationship.**

---

## What Not to Do

- Announce via text/email
- Involve children in decision
- Badmouth to mutual friends
- Rush to new relationship
- Make permanent decisions in crisis moment
- Let anger drive financial decisions
