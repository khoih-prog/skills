# Newlywed Phase (0-2 Years)

Transition from dating to married life. Building foundations, adjusting expectations.

## Reality Adjustment

**Common surprises:**
- Living together full-time reveals new habits
- "Romance" becomes daily logistics
- In-laws become family, not just his/her parents
- Legal and financial entanglement is real

**Normalize:** First years are adjustment, not failure if hard.

## Fighting Fair

**Establish early:**

1. **No contempt** — Eye rolls, mockery, disgust destroy marriages
2. **No stonewalling** — Walking away without return plan
3. **Repair attempts** — Inside jokes, touch, humor to de-escalate
4. **Cool-down protocol** — "I need 20 minutes" with committed return

**Conflict structure:**
- "When you [behavior], I feel [emotion], I need [request]"
- One issue at a time (no kitchen-sinking)
- No "always" or "never"
- Attack problem, not person

## Money Habits

**Build now:**
- Regular money meetings (weekly or monthly)
- Transparent spending over threshold
- Shared goals visualization
- Emergency fund priority
- No financial secrets

**Common newlywed money fights:**
- Different spending styles
- Who pays for what
- Gifts to family
- Lifestyle expectations mismatch

## In-Law Navigation

**Establish:**
- United front (disagree privately)
- Each person manages their own family
- Clear boundaries delivered with kindness
- Holiday rotation or new traditions

**When in-laws overstep:**
- Partner addresses their own parents
- "We've decided..." not "She says..."
- Protect spouse, maintain relationship

## Intimacy Foundations

**Expect changes:**
- Honeymoon phase fades (normal)
- Frequency negotiations needed
- Initiation patterns to discuss
- Non-sexual intimacy matters too

**Build habits:**
- Regular check-ins about satisfaction
- Permission to say no without rejection spiral
- Scheduling isn't unromantic, it's realistic

---

## Household Labor

**Divide intentionally:**
- List all tasks (including invisible mental load)
- Assign by preference, skill, availability
- Standards conversation: "clean enough"
- Renegotiate when life changes

**Avoid:**
- Scorekeeper mentality
- "Helping" (it's your house too)
- Waiting to be asked for obvious needs

---

## Staying Connected

**Protect:**
- Date nights (non-negotiable)
- Small daily rituals (morning coffee, evening walk)
- Physical affection outside sex
- Interest in each other's days

**Kill patterns:**
- Parallel lives (same house, different worlds)
- Phone during meals
- Taking each other for granted

---

## Creating Traditions

**Your marriage, your rules:**
- New holiday rituals
- Anniversary traditions
- Inside jokes and language
- "Our way" of doing things

---

## Big Decisions Framework

**Before major choices:**
1. Both get full information
2. Discuss separately, then together
3. Understand each other's fears
4. Find win-win or fair compromise
5. United front once decided
