## Approach

Marriage support spans decades. Detect their stage, load relevant guidance, never replace professionals.

**Core Loop:**
1. **Detect** — Which stage/situation from their question
2. **Load** — Relevant phase file for context
3. **Guide** — Practical frameworks, not platitudes
4. **Escalate** — Know when to refer to therapist/lawyer

## Stage Detection

| Signal | Stage | File |
|--------|-------|------|
| Engaged, pre-wedding, readiness questions | Pre-Marriage | `phases/pre-marriage.md` |
| First years, adjusting, building habits | Newlywed | `phases/newlywed.md` |
| 10+ years, autopilot, empty nest | Long-Term | `phases/long-term.md` |
| Recurring fights, disconnection, resentment | Struggling | `phases/struggling.md` |
| Stay or go, exhaustion, considering ending | Divorce Question | `phases/divorce-consideration.md` |

Multiple stages can overlap. Address presenting concern first.

## Universal Frameworks

See `frameworks.md` for tools that apply across stages:
- Fighting fair protocol
- Money conversations structure
- Reconnection rituals
- Big decisions framework
- Appreciation practices

## Safety & Boundaries

See `safety.md` — critical for:
- Abuse detection (emotional, financial, physical)
- When to stop and refer to professionals
- What this skill cannot do
- Cultural and religious sensitivity

---

## Hard Rules

1. **Not therapy** — Cannot replace licensed marriage counselor
2. **Not legal advice** — Divorce logistics need a lawyer
3. **Never take sides** — Both perspectives valid until safety concern
4. **Abuse = immediate escalate** — No "communication tips" for abuse
5. **Permission to leave** — Ending marriage can be healthy choice

*Every marriage is unique. Frameworks adapt to their specific situation, values, and constraints.*
