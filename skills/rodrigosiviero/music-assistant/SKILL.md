# Music Assistant

Control your Music Assistant server for music playback, queue management, and library browsing.

## Setup

Before using this skill, you need to configure your Music Assistant connection:

```bash
# Required
export MA_URL="http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8095/api"
export MA_TOKEN="YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN"

# Optional - auto-detected if not set
export MA_PLAYER="your_player_id"
```

**Finding your token:**
1. Open Music Assistant web UI
2. Go to Settings → Security
3. Create or copy your Long-Lived Access Token

**Finding your player ID:**
```bash
./scripts/mactl.py players
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Basic controls
./scripts/mactl.py play          # Play/pause toggle
./scripts/mactl.py next          # Skip track
./scripts/mactl.py volume 75     # Set volume to 75%

# Search and play
./scripts/mactl.py search "nirvana"
./scripts/mactl.py play-search "pink floyd"  # Search and play first result

# Check what's playing
./scripts/mactl.py status
./scripts/mactl.py queue
```

## Playback Controls

```bash
./scripts/mactl.py play          # Play/pause toggle
./scripts/mactl.py pause         # Pause
./scripts/mactl.py stop          # Stop playback
./scripts/mactl.py next          # Next track
./scripts/mactl.py prev          # Previous track
```

## Volume

```bash
./scripts/mactl.py volume 75     # Set volume 0-100
./scripts/mactl.py mute          # Mute
./scripts/mactl.py unmute        # Unmute
```

## Queue Management

```bash
./scripts/mactl.py shuffle true  # Enable shuffle
./scripts/mactl.py shuffle false # Disable shuffle
./scripts/mactl.py repeat all    # Repeat mode (off|all|one)
./scripts/mactl.py clear         # Clear queue
./scripts/mactl.py queue-items   # List queue contents
```

## Search & Play

```bash
# Search library
./scripts/mactl.py search "pink floyd"
./scripts/mactl.py search "nirvana" --type track album
./scripts/mactl.py search "metallica" --limit 5

# Search and immediately play first result
./scripts/mactl.py play-search "smells like teen spirit"
./scripts/mactl.py ps "comfortably numb"  # shorthand

# Play by URI (for scripts/advanced use)
./scripts/mactl.py play-uri "spotify://track/4gHnSNHs8RyVukKoWdS99f"
```

## Status & Info

```bash
./scripts/mactl.py status        # Show player status + now playing
./scripts/mactl.py queue         # Queue status
./scripts/mactl.py recent        # Recently played items
./scripts/mactl.py players       # List all available players
```

## Library

```bash
./scripts/mactl.py sync          # Trigger library sync
```

## Examples

**"Play some Nirvana"**
```bash
./scripts/mactl.py play-search "nirvana"
```

**"What's playing?"**
```bash
./scripts/mactl.py status
```

**"Skip this track"**
```bash
./scripts/mactl.py next
```

**"Set volume to 50%"**
```bash
./scripts/mactl.py volume 50
```

**"Turn on shuffle"**
```bash
./scripts/mactl.py shuffle true
```

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MA_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"message_id":"1","command":"player_queues/all"}'
