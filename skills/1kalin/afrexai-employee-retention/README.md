# Employee Retention & Turnover Risk Analyzer

Stop bleeding talent. Diagnose retention risks across 8 dimensions, calculate replacement costs, and get a 90-day fix plan.

## What You Get

- **8-dimension retention scoring** (0-100 each): compensation, career progression, manager quality, workload, culture, recognition, flexibility, onboarding
- **Replacement cost calculator** by role level (50-400% of salary)
- **2026 industry benchmarks** for 10 verticals
- **AI-era retention factors** — role anxiety, tool fatigue, upskilling gaps
- **Red flag detection** — pattern combinations that predict attrition waves
- **90-day action plan** with ROI estimates

## Quick Start

Give your agent this skill, then ask:
- "Run a retention risk assessment for my 45-person engineering team"
- "Calculate our annual turnover cost"
- "What are the top 3 retention levers for a SaaS company at 18% attrition?"

## Why This Matters

Replacing one mid-level employee costs $90K-$180K. A 50-person company losing 5 people per year wastes $450K-$900K — before counting lost knowledge, team disruption, and recruitment time.

Most companies measure turnover after it happens. This skill measures the conditions that cause it.
