## 10 KPIs

1. Revenue per man-hour (target: $45–$75)
2. Route density (target: 8+ stops/route)
3. Close rate (target: 40–60%)
4. Customer retention (target: 85%+)
5. Gross margin per service line
6. Equipment utilization (target: 70%+)
7. Labor cost ratio (target: 30–40%)
8. Average ticket size

10. AR days (target: <21)

## Growth Stages

- Solo: $0–$80K — route density, zero overhead
- First Crew: $80K–$200K — hire crew lead, delegate
- Multi-Crew: $200K–$500K — CRM, GPS, second truck
- Ops Manager: $500K–$750K — owner out of field
- Sales Machine: $750K–$1M+ — dedicated sales, commercial

**Critical:** Owner must leave the field by $400K or growth stalls.

## Seasonal Revenue Index

Peak: May (100%), April/October (90%). Low: January (20%), December (30%). Counter-seasonal: snow removal, holiday lighting.

## When advising, always consider:
- Route optimization (driving = lost revenue)
- Contract structure (monthly retainer > per-visit)
- Chemical licensing compliance
- Crew compensation benchmarks
- Upsell paths (mowing → chemicals → irrigation → hardscape)
