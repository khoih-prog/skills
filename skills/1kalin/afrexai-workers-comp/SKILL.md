## Experience Modification Rate (EMR)

EMR = Actual Losses / Expected Losses (simplified)

**What affects it:**
- Claims frequency (number of claims matters MORE than severity)
- 3-year lookback period (excluding most recent year)
- Primary vs excess losses (split point ~$18,500, adjusted annually)
- Payroll volume by class code

**EMR Impact Table:**

| EMR | Premium Impact | What It Means |
|-----|---------------|---------------|
| 0.70 | 30% discount | Excellent safety record |
| 0.85 | 15% discount | Better than average |
| 1.00 | Baseline | Industry average |
| 1.15 | 15% surcharge | Below average |
| 1.40 | 40% surcharge | Poor — may lose coverage |
| 1.75+ | 75%+ surcharge | Assigned risk pool territory |

**Cost of a single claim on EMR:**
- $10K claim → ~$3,000-$5,000/year in extra premium for 3 years = $9K-$15K total cost
- $50K claim → ~$8,000-$12,000/year extra = $24K-$36K total
- Frequency penalty: 5 x $2K claims costs MORE than 1 x $10K claim

## State Requirements Matrix

### Monopolistic States (Must buy from state fund)
- Ohio (BWC)
- North Dakota (WSI)
- Washington (L&I)
- Wyoming (WCD)

### Competitive States (Private market)
- All other 46 states + DC

### Key Variations
| Requirement | Typical | Notable Exceptions |
|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| Coverage trigger | 1+ employees | TX (optional), FL (4+ non-construction) |
| Sole proprietor exempt | Yes | Some states require if in construction |
| Posting requirement | Yes — all states | Format varies by state |
| First report of injury | Within 7 days | Some states require 3-5 days |
| Penalties for no coverage | $1K-$100K+ | CA: misdemeanor + $10K-$100K; NY: felony |

### Texas — The Exception
Texas is the only state where workers' comp is truly optional. But:
- Non-subscribers lose common-law defenses (contributory negligence, fellow servant rule, assumption of risk)
- Must file DWC Form-005 annually
- Must notify employees of non-coverage
- Lawsuit exposure is significantly higher

## Premium Audit Checklist

Run this annually (or at audit time):

- [ ] Verify all class codes match actual job duties (not job titles)
- [ ] Separate clerical employees from operations where allowed
- [ ] Confirm executive/officer exclusions are filed
- [ ] Check subcontractor certificates of insurance (uninsured subs = your payroll)
- [ ] Verify overtime is reported at straight-time rate only
- [ ] Exclude group health, pension contributions, tips from payroll
- [ ] Review dual-wage employees — allocate to lowest-rated class if records support it
- [ ] Confirm seasonal/temporary workers are properly classified
- [ ] Check if any employees moved between states (affects rating)
- [ ] Verify MOD worksheet — are all claims accurately reported?

## Common Overcharges to Catch

1. **Wrong class code** — Office manager coded as warehouse worker
2. **Overtime at premium rate** — Should be straight-time only for WC purposes
3. **Uninsured sub included** — Get certificates or they become your payroll
4. **Executive included** — Most states allow officer exclusion (limits apply)
5. **Tips/benefits included** — Generally excludable from WC payroll
6. **Stale claims on MOD** — Claims older than 3-year window still showing
7. **Closed claims with reserves** — Ask carrier to release reserves on resolved claims

## Return-to-Work Program Framework

**Why it matters:** Every day an injured worker stays out = $200-$500 in indirect costs on top of the claim.

1. **Modified duty program** — Document 5-10 light-duty positions available at all times
2. **Communication protocol** — Contact injured worker within 24 hours, weekly check-ins
3. **Medical provider network** — Pre-select occupational health clinics (faster, cheaper, better outcomes)
4. **Transitional work plan** — Written agreement: modified duties, hours, duration, review dates
5. **Outcome tracking** — Days away from work, claim duration, recurrence rate

## Fraud Red Flags

- Injury reported Monday for something that "happened Friday"
- No witnesses despite busy workplace
- Employee recently received disciplinary action or termination notice
- Claim filed right before layoff, strike, or seasonal shutdown
- Medical treatment from out-of-area provider
- Attorney retained immediately
- History of frequent claims across employers
- Inconsistent injury descriptions between report and medical records

## Cost-Per-Injury Reference (OSHA/NSC Data)

| Fall (same level) | $25,000 | $50,000-$75,000 |
| Fall (elevation) | $75,000 | $150,000-$375,000 |

Indirect costs include: lost productivity, overtime for coverage, training replacement, administrative time, OSHA fines, litigation.
