# sovereign-test-generator

Analyzes codebases and generates comprehensive, production-grade test suites. Covers unit tests, integration tests, edge cases, mocking strategies, and framework-specific patterns.

## What It Does

When you install this skill, your AI agent gains the ability to:

1. **Analyze code for testability** -- Identifies public API surface, complexity hotspots, coupling points, and risk factors
2. **Generate complete test files** -- Produces runnable test suites with proper imports, fixtures, assertions, and teardown
3. **Identify missing edge cases** -- Systematically finds boundary values, error paths, type coercion issues, and concurrency bugs you haven't considered
4. **Plan mocking strategy** -- Determines what to mock, what to test directly, and which technique (mock/stub/spy/fake) fits each dependency
5. **Prioritize test effort** -- Uses a risk matrix to focus testing on code that is most likely to break and most expensive when it does

## Supported Frameworks

| Language | Frameworks | File Pattern |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| JavaScript | Jest, Vitest | `*.test.js`, `*.spec.js` |
| TypeScript | Jest, Vitest | `*.test.ts`, `*.spec.ts` |
| Python | pytest | `test_*.py`, `*_test.py` |
| Go | testing + testify | `*_test.go` |
| Rust | #[test] + mockall | `mod tests` block |

## Install

```bash
clawhub install sovereign-test-generator
```

## Usage

After installation, ask your agent to generate tests:

```
Generate comprehensive tests for this Express.js API endpoint.
```

```
Write pytest tests for this Python service class, including all edge cases.
```

```
What edge cases am I missing in this function? List every case I should test.
```

```
Create integration tests for this database repository using an in-memory SQLite database.
```

```
Generate a mock strategy for this service -- what should I mock and what should I test directly?
```

The agent will produce complete, runnable test files that you can drop into your project and execute immediately.

## What Makes This Different

This is not a "generate boilerplate test" skill. It performs genuine analysis:

- **Risk-based prioritization** -- Tests high-complexity, high-coupling code first
- **Real edge cases** -- Goes beyond happy path to test nulls, boundary values, concurrent access, and error propagation
- **Mock discipline** -- Only mocks external boundaries (databases, APIs, file system). Never mocks internal logic, which produces false-passing tests.
- **Framework expertise** -- Generates idiomatic code for each framework, using `pytest.mark.parametrize`, Go table-driven tests, Rust `#[should_panic]`, Jest `toMatchInlineSnapshot`, and more
