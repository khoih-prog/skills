# Engineering as Marketing

Grow a product by building free tools that rank for low-competition keywords and convert visitors into paying customers. Zero ad spend required.

## Strategy Overview

1. Find low-competition keywords (KD < 15, volume > 500) with tool-intent modifiers (generator, checker, converter, validator, calculator)
2. Build simple, single-purpose free tools targeting each keyword
3. Host on your product domain (`/tools/[slug]`) to inherit domain authority
4. Add contextual CTAs linking each tool to your main product
5. Scale: use the first tool as a template, create new tools in minutes with AI

**Proven benchmark:** 50+ tools → 50K monthly visitors → $13K MRR, $0 marketing budget.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Keyword Discovery

Find opportunities with high volume and low competition:

```
Seed terms: words related to your product domain
Modifiers: generator, checker, converter, validator, calculator, tester, maker, builder, finder
Formula: [seed] + [modifier] → check KD + volume → prioritize by volume/KD ratio
```

Filter: **KD ≤ 15**, **volume ≥ 500**, **relevant to your audience**.

### Phase 2: Tool Design & Build

Four proven patterns:

| Pattern | Example | Effort | Volume |
|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| Converter/Generator | PDF→Markdown, color palette | Low | High |
| Checker/Validator | SSL checker, sitemap validator | Medium | High |
| Calculator/Estimator | ROI calculator, pricing estimator | Low | Medium |
| AI-Powered Generator | Meta description writer, FAQ generator | Medium | High |

**Build process:**
1. Create first tool manually (this is your template)
2. For each new keyword: give AI the template + target keyword → generates tool in < 5 min
3. Deploy at `/tools/[keyword-slug]` on product domain

For tool page anatomy, SEO checklist, and tech stack recommendations → read [references/strategy-playbook.md](references/strategy-playbook.md) sections 3 and 5.

### Phase 3: Convert & Measure

Each tool page needs a **contextual CTA** connecting to your product:

- Converter → "Need to convert at scale? Try [Product]"
- Checker → "Found issues? [Product] monitors automatically"
- Generator → "[Product] does this + 10x more"

**Target funnel:** Tool visitors → 3-5% click CTA → 25-40% trial-to-paid conversion.
