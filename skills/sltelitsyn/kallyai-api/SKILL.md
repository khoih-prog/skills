# KallyAI Executive Assistant

KallyAI is an AI executive assistant that handles outbound + inbound calls, email, bookings, research, bills, rides, food orders, errands, multi-channel messaging, and phone number management — all from the terminal.

## Quick Start

```bash
# The 80% command — natural language, routes automatically
python kallyai.py ask "Book a table at Nobu for 4 tonight"
python kallyai.py ask "Email Dr. Smith to reschedule my Thursday appointment"
python kallyai.py ask "Find the best plumber near me and negotiate a quote"

# Check credits (NOT minutes — credits are the sole billing unit)
python kallyai.py credits balance

# Check your inbox
python kallyai.py messages inbox

# View incoming calls handled by your AI receptionist
python kallyai.py inbound calls
```

## Complete Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Intent

Determine what the user needs. KallyAI covers 14 domains:

| Domain | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| **Coordination** | "Book a table", "Handle this for me", any multi-step request |
| **Calls** | Call a business, check on a reservation, negotiate |
| **Inbound** | View incoming calls, manage routing rules, voicemails, contacts |
| **Phone** | Provision numbers, set up forwarding, manage caller ID |
| **Actions** | Calendar events, bookings, bill analysis, rides, food, errands |
| **Messages** | Check inbox, read messages, view threads |
| **Search** | Find businesses, research options, compare prices |
| **Email** | Send emails, manage accounts, train voice profile |
| **Channels** | Manage WhatsApp, Telegram, email contacts, channel status |
| **Outreach** | Multi-channel outreach tasks (call + email + messaging) |
| **Budget** | Estimate costs, approve budgets, view breakdowns |
| **Credits** | Check balance, view history, spending breakdown, plans |
| **Subscription** | Change plan, view status, cancel pending changes |
| **Referrals** | Get referral code, view stats, track referrals |

**For most requests, use `ask`** — it routes through the coordination AI automatically.

### Step 2: Authenticate

Authentication is automatic. First API call opens browser for Google/Apple sign-in.

```bash
python kallyai.py login         # Force re-auth
python kallyai.py logout        # Clear credentials
python kallyai.py auth-status   # Check login
```

### Step 3: Execute

**Natural language (preferred):**
```bash
python kallyai.py ask "Reserve a table for 4 at 8pm at Nobu"
```

**Direct commands (when you know the domain):**
```bash
python kallyai.py calls make -p "+15551234567" -t "Reserve table for 4 at 8pm"
python kallyai.py actions calendar create --title "Dinner" --start "2026-02-14T20:00"
python kallyai.py search run "best Italian restaurant downtown"
python kallyai.py inbound calls --status completed
python kallyai.py phone list
```

### Step 4: Monitor & Follow Up

```bash
# Check goal status
python kallyai.py coord goals --status active
python kallyai.py coord goal <GOAL_ID>

# Review outbound call results
python kallyai.py calls history
python kallyai.py calls info <CALL_ID>
python kallyai.py calls transcript <CALL_ID>

# Review inbound calls handled by AI receptionist
python kallyai.py inbound calls
python kallyai.py inbound call <CALL_ID>
python kallyai.py inbound transcript <CALL_ID>

# Check inbox for responses
python kallyai.py messages inbox --unread
```

## Output Format

Default output is **JSON** (machine-readable for Claude Code). Add `--human` for formatted tables.

```bash
python kallyai.py credits balance              # JSON
python kallyai.py credits balance --human      # Pretty table
```

## Backward Compatibility

Old flags still work — they map to new subcommands:

```bash
python kallyai.py --phone "+1..." --task "..."   → calls make
python kallyai.py --usage                         → credits balance
python kallyai.py --history                       → calls history
python kallyai.py --call-info ID                  → calls info ID
python kallyai.py --transcript ID                 → calls transcript ID
```
