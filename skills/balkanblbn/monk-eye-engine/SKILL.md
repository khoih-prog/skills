# MONK-EYE 👁️ - Deep Intelligence & Human Experience Oracle

MONK-EYE is a specialized OpenClaw skill designed for deep infiltration and synthesis of forum-based human intelligence. While most search tools focus on surface-level web pages, MONK-EYE dives into the "tacit knowledge" buried in the world's most active and niche forums (R10, BlackHatWorld, Reddit, Habr, etc.).

## 🐒 The Philosophy
"Millions of discussions, one truth." MONK-EYE operates on the belief that the most valuable information (trade secrets, proven methods, real failure cases) is not found in articles, but in human-to-human forum debates.

## 🛠️ Operational Phases (The 4 Pillars)
1. **REFRACTION:** Breaks a simple query into 25+ micro-searches in multiple languages and technical contexts.
2. **INFILTRATION:** Simultaneously scans 500+ deep sources, following links recursively (Depth: 2+).
3. **DISTILLATION:** Filters 95% noise (ads, thanks, spam) using quantum-style pattern matching to find "proof-of-work" data.
4. **SYNTHESIS:** Outputs a high-level "Colossus Dossier" with actionable strategies and proven insights.

```bash
openclaw install monk-eye-engine
