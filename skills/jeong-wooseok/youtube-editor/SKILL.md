  ```
- **Windows:**
  Download from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add it to your PATH.

### 2. API Keys
Add these keys to your OpenClaw environment (`~/.openclaw/.env`) or export them in your shell.

## 🚀 Usage

### Option 1: Process a YouTube Video
Simply provide the URL. The skill will download the best quality available.

```bash
uv run ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/youtube-editor/scripts/process_video.py --url "https://youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR_VIDEO_ID"

### Option 2: Process a Local File
If you already have the video file on your computer.

```bash
uv run ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/youtube-editor/scripts/process_video.py --input "/path/to/your/video.mp4"
```

## 📂 Output

The skill creates a new folder named `output_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/` containing:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `audio.mp3` | Extracted audio track |
| `subtitles.srt` | Subtitle file (upload this to YouTube for CC) |
| `transcript.txt` | Full text transcript of the video |
| `metadata.md` | **Title, Description, Tags** generated by AI |
| `thumbnail.png` | **4K Thumbnail** generated by AI |
| `downloaded_video.mp4` | The source video (if downloaded from URL) |

## ❓ Troubleshooting

**Error: `FFmpeg not found`**
- Make sure you installed FFmpeg and it's available in your system PATH.
- Try running `ffmpeg -version` in your terminal to verify.

**Error: `OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is not set`**
- Check your `.env` file or export the key manually: `export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`

**Thumbnail generation failed?**
- Ensure you have the `nano-banana-pro` skill installed and your `NANO_BANANA_KEY` is valid.
