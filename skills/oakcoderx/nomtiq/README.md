# 小饭票 Nomtiq 🎫

**一顿饭就是一段时光。**
**A meal is a moment.**

小饭票从一个习惯开始——

我们写代码，开会，赶 deadline。一天结束，想找个地方好好吃顿饭，陪陪重要的人。但找餐厅这件事，比想象中难。

我的好朋友常常在亮马河一带请我吃饭。不去网红店，不刷榜单。就是找一家有意思的本地馆子，两个人坐下来，聊聊最近在做什么，聊聊工作和生活，偶尔抬头看天。

找餐厅其实不容易。一切都需要合适——但什么是合适呢？社交媒体的推荐太虚假，榜单里全是广告，大众点评其实不知道你喜欢什么，它只知道什么是流行的。

所以我写了小饭票。没有排行榜。

它记得你的口味，知道你去过哪里，了解你的预算和区域。它不给你推广告，只给你值得去的地方。用得越久，越懂你。

合适，就是我们一起花的时间。

It started with a habit.

We write code, sit in meetings, chase deadlines. At the end of the day, you want to find a good place to eat — and actually be present with the people who matter. But finding the right restaurant is harder than it sounds.

A friend of mine would take me to dinner along Liangma River — not the trending spots, not the ranked lists. Just a local place worth sitting in. Two people, a table, time to talk about what's been going on.

Finding the right restaurant is harder than it sounds. Everything has to fit. But what does *fit* mean? Social media recommendations are noise. Rankings are ads. Dianping knows what's popular — it doesn't know what you like.

So I built Nomtiq. No rankings.

It remembers your taste. Knows where you've been, what you liked, what you didn't. It doesn't push ads. It finds places worth going to. The longer you use it, the better it knows you.

The right fit isn't a rating. It's the time we spend together.

## 🔒 隐藏菜单 / Hidden Menu

小饭票有一个隐藏菜单模式。

专为重要的时光设计。特定的地方，有趣的食物，适合聊天的环境。需要你留心地记录，推荐就会越来越有趣。不追求准确，是时光里两个人的小冒险。

一顿好饭，一段记得的时光。

There's a hidden menu.

Designed for moments that matter. A specific place, interesting food, somewhere good for conversation. The more you record, the better it gets. Not about precision — it's a small adventure for two.

A good meal. A moment worth remembering.
