## Overview

This skill interacts with the PoidhV3 contract on Base to:

1. **Post bounties** (solo or open)
2. **Evaluate claim submissions** using vision — fetch the image URI from each claim and compare against the bounty description
3. **Accept the winning claim** (solo bounty) or **initiate + resolve a vote** (open bounty)

**poidh** ("pics or it didn't happen") is a fully on-chain bounty protocol. Claimants submit photo proof, and the bounty issuer (or contributors via vote) accepts the best claim to release funds.

> ⚠️ The PoidhV3 contract enforces `msg.sender == tx.origin`. Only **EOA wallets** can create or accept bounties. Smart contract wallets (Safe, etc.) will revert with `ContractsCannotCreateBounties`.

## Part 1: Posting a Bounty

### Check Minimum Bounty Amount

```bash
cast call $POIDH_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "MIN_BOUNTY_AMOUNT()(uint256)" --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

### Post a Solo Bounty

Solo = only you fund it; you accept claims directly with no vote required.

```bash
cast send $POIDH_CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
  "createSoloBounty(string,string)" \
  "<BOUNTY_NAME>" \
  "<BOUNTY_DESCRIPTION>" \
  --value <AMOUNT> \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

**Example:**

```bash
cast send $POIDH_CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
  "createSoloBounty(string,string)" \
  "Brooklyn Bridge at sunset" \
  "High quality photo of the Brooklyn Bridge during golden hour. Must show the full span." \
  --value 0.001ether \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

### Post an Open Bounty

Open = others can co-fund; claim acceptance requires a contributor-weighted vote.

```bash
cast send $POIDH_CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
  "createOpenBounty(string,string)" \
  "<BOUNTY_NAME>" \
  "<BOUNTY_DESCRIPTION>" \
  --value <AMOUNT> \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

### Get the Bounty ID After Posting

```bash
cast receipt <TX_HASH> --rpc-url $RPC_URL --json | \
  python3 -c "
import sys, json
receipt = json.load(sys.stdin)
for log in receipt['logs']:
    if log['address'].lower() == '$POIDH_CONTRACT_ADDRESS'.lower() and len(log['topics']) >= 2:
        bounty_id = int(log['topics'][1], 16)
        print(f'Bounty ID: {bounty_id}')
        print(f'View at: https://poidh.xyz/base/{bounty_id}')
        break
"
```

## Part 2: Evaluating Claims

When the user wants to pick a winner, the agent must:

1. Fetch all claims for the bounty
2. Retrieve each claim's URI from the NFT contract
3. Fetch and evaluate the content against the bounty description
4. Pick the best match

Claim submissions are freeform — the URI could point to an image, a video, a tweet, a GitHub PR, a webpage, a document, or anything else. Evaluate whatever you find against what the bounty asked for.

### Step 1: Fetch Claims for a Bounty

```bash
cast call $POIDH_CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
  "getClaimsByBountyId(uint256,uint256)(tuple(uint256,address,uint256,address,string,string,uint256,bool)[])" \
  <BOUNTY_ID> 0 \
  --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

Returns up to 10 claims (most recent first). Increment offset by 10 to paginate. Each claim tuple:
`(id, issuer, bountyId, bountyIssuer, name, description, createdAt, accepted)`

The `name` and `description` fields on the claim are also set by the claimant and may give useful context about what they submitted.

### Step 2: Get the URI for Each Claim

```bash
# Get NFT contract address
NFT_ADDRESS=$(cast call $POIDH_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "poidhNft()(address)" --rpc-url $RPC_URL)

# Get token URI for a specific claim
cast call $NFT_ADDRESS "tokenURI(uint256)(string)" <CLAIM_ID> --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

### Step 3: Resolve the URI

Convert non-HTTP URIs to fetchable URLs:

```python
uri = "<URI_FROM_TOKEN>"
if uri.startswith("ipfs://"):
    url = uri.replace("ipfs://", "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/")
elif uri.startswith("ar://"):
    url = uri.replace("ar://", "https://arweave.net/")
else:
    url = uri  # already HTTP
```

If the URL returns JSON metadata (standard ERC721 format), check for an `image` or `animation_url` field and resolve those too:

```python
import requests

response = requests.get(url)
try:
    meta = response.json()
    # Prefer animation_url (video/interactive) over image if both present
    content_url = meta.get("animation_url") or meta.get("image") or url
    if content_url.startswith("ipfs://"):
        content_url = content_url.replace("ipfs://", "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/")
except Exception:
    content_url = url  # URI points directly to the content
```

### Step 4: Evaluate the Content

Fetch and review the content at `content_url`. Use the appropriate method based on what you find:

- **Image** — use native vision to view it directly
- **Webpage / tweet / article** — use the web fetch tool to read the content
- **Video** — note the URL and evaluate based on the thumbnail or any available metadata
- **Document / PDF** — fetch and read the text content

Evaluate each claim against the bounty `name` and `description` on:

- **Relevance** — does the submission match what was actually asked for?
- **Quality** — is it complete, clear, and unambiguous?
- **Authenticity** — does it appear genuine and original (not recycled or faked)?

Pick the claim with the highest overall score. Present your reasoning to the user before executing any transaction.

## Part 3: Accepting a Winning Claim — Solo Bounty

For solo bounties (and open bounties where no external contributors ever joined), the issuer accepts directly. This immediately finalizes the bounty, credits the claimant payout to `pendingWithdrawals`, takes the 2.5% protocol fee, and transfers the claim NFT to the issuer.

```bash
cast send $POIDH_CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
  "acceptClaim(uint256,uint256)" \
  <BOUNTY_ID> <CLAIM_ID> \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

---

## Part 4: Accepting a Winning Claim — Open Bounty (Vote Flow)

For open bounties where external contributors have joined, direct accept is blocked. Use the two-step vote flow.

### Check if External Contributors Exist

```bash
cast call $POIDH_CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
  "everHadExternalContributor(uint256)(bool)" \
  <BOUNTY_ID> \
  --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

If `false`, fall back to `acceptClaim` (Part 3). If `true`, proceed with the vote flow below.

### Step 1: Submit the Chosen Claim for Vote (Issuer Only)

The issuer's full contribution weight is automatically cast as a YES vote at this point.

```bash
cast send $POIDH_CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
  "submitClaimForVote(uint256,uint256)" \
  <BOUNTY_ID> <CLAIM_ID> \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

After this call, other contributors have **2 days** to vote YES/NO via the poidh.xyz UI or by calling `voteClaim(bountyId, bool)` directly.

### Step 2: Check Vote Status

```bash
cast call $POIDH_CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
  "bountyVotingTracker(uint256)(uint256,uint256,uint256)" \
  <BOUNTY_ID> \
  --rpc-url $RPC_URL
# Returns: yes_weight, no_weight, deadline_timestamp
```

```bash
python3 -c "import time; deadline=<DEADLINE>; print('Voting ended' if time.time() > deadline else f'Voting ends in {int((deadline - time.time())/3600)}h')"
```

### Step 3: Resolve the Vote (Permissionless)

After the 2-day window closes, anyone can resolve. If YES weight > 50% of total weight, the claim is accepted and funds are distributed.

```bash
cast send $POIDH_CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
  "resolveVote(uint256)" \
  <BOUNTY_ID> \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

## Part 5: Submitting a Claim on Someone Else's Bounty

Any EOA (except the bounty issuer) can submit a claim on an active open or solo bounty. This is how the agent acts as a **claimant** rather than an issuer. No ETH is required.

The `uri` is the proof of completion — it can be anything: an IPFS image hash, a direct image URL, a tweet, a GitHub link, a webpage, a video, etc. It gets minted into a claim NFT at submission time.

### Check That the Bounty is Active

Before submitting, verify the bounty exists, is not finalized, and has no ongoing vote:

```bash
cast call $POIDH_CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
  "bounties(uint256)(uint256,address,string,string,uint256,address,uint256,uint256)" \
  <BOUNTY_ID> \
  --rpc-url $RPC_URL
# Returns: id, issuer, name, description, amount, claimer, createdAt, claimId
# claimer == 0x0 means active; claimer == issuer means cancelled; claimer == other means already won
```

Also confirm no vote is currently in progress:

```bash
cast call $POIDH_CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
  "bountyCurrentVotingClaim(uint256)(uint256)" \
  <BOUNTY_ID> \
  --rpc-url $RPC_URL
# Returns 0 if no active vote — safe to submit
```

### Submit the Claim

```bash
cast send $POIDH_CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
  "createClaim(uint256,string,string,string)" \
  <BOUNTY_ID> \
  "<CLAIM_NAME>" \
  "<CLAIM_DESCRIPTION>" \
  "<PROOF_URI>" \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

- `CLAIM_NAME` — short title for the submission
- `CLAIM_DESCRIPTION` — explanation of how the bounty was completed
- `PROOF_URI` — the actual proof (image URL, IPFS URI, tweet URL, GitHub link, etc.)

**Example:**

```bash
cast send $POIDH_CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
  "createClaim(uint256,string,string,string)" \
  42 \
  "Brooklyn Bridge golden hour" \
  "Took this photo at 7:43pm on the Manhattan side. Full span visible with reflection in the water." \
  "ipfs://QmXyz..." \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

### Get the Claim ID After Submitting

```bash
cast receipt <TX_HASH> --rpc-url $RPC_URL --json | \
  python3 -c "
import sys, json
receipt = json.load(sys.stdin)
for log in receipt['logs']:
    if log['address'].lower() == '$POIDH_CONTRACT_ADDRESS'.lower() and len(log['topics']) >= 2:
        claim_id = int(log['topics'][1], 16)
        print(f'Claim ID: {claim_id}')
        break
"
```

### Important Constraints

- The agent's wallet (`PRIVATE_KEY`) cannot be the bounty issuer — `IssuerCannotClaim` will revert
- Submitting is blocked while a vote is active on that bounty — `VotingOngoing` will revert
- The bounty must still be open — finalized or cancelled bounties will revert
- There is no limit to the number of claims per bounty; the issuer picks the best one

## Agent Decision Flow

### Posting a Bounty

1. Ask for: **name**, **description**, **ETH amount**, **type** (solo or open — default solo)
2. Confirm with user before sending — this spends real ETH
3. Run `createSoloBounty` or `createOpenBounty`
4. Return tx hash and `https://poidh.xyz/base/<bountyId>`

### Submitting a Claim

1. Ask for: **bounty ID**, **proof URI** (image, link, IPFS hash, etc.), **claim name**, **claim description**
2. Verify the bounty is active and has no ongoing vote
3. Confirm the agent's wallet is not the bounty issuer
4. Confirm with user before sending
5. Call `createClaim(bountyId, name, description, uri)`
6. Return the claim ID and tx hash

### Evaluating and Accepting

1. Ask for the **bounty ID**
2. Check `everHadExternalContributor` to determine the correct acceptance path
3. Fetch all active (non-accepted) claims via `getClaimsByBountyId`
4. For each claim: get `tokenURI`, resolve URI, evaluate content using the appropriate tool (vision for images, web fetch for links, etc.)
5. Present recommended winner + reasoning to user, confirm before transacting
6. **Solo / no external contributors**: `acceptClaim(bountyId, claimId)`
7. **Open with external contributors**: `submitClaimForVote(bountyId, claimId)`, inform user contributors have 2 days to vote, then `resolveVote` after deadline
