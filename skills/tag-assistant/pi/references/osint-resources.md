## Pro Tips

1. **State bid documents** are goldmines — government RFPs list company reps with direct phone/email
2. **University/school donor pages** often list people who don't appear anywhere else online
3. **Wedding registries** (The Knot, Zola) can reveal partner names and dates
4. **Marathon/race results** — many runners use real names, reveal age and city
5. **Fishing/hunting license databases** — some states make these public
6. **Voter registration** — FL voter rolls are public (request from Supervisor of Elections)
7. **Professional licenses** — FL DBPR (myfloridalicense.com) for RE agents, contractors, etc.
